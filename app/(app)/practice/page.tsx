      Prisma deduplicates in the client, so a `LIMIT` would cut rows before the
      deduplication and it emits none: the SQL was every card this learner
      owns, and then `examples`, the longest column in the schema, fetched once
      per card rather than once per word. A word with five card types was read
      five times.

      Asking Lexeme instead is one row per word by construction, so the cap is
      a real `LIMIT` and the join happens once. Two thousand is past any deck
      somebody has actually built, and ordered, so a learner who does get there
      is told the same number twice rather than a different one each load.

      Ordered to the end, since the lemma is not what identifies a row here:
      `Lexeme` is unique on `(lemma, pos)`, so two entries sharing a lemma tie,
