/**
 * The mastered list, and the two lists either side of it.
 *
 * Asked for directly, twice: which words are known, which are nearly there,
 * and which keep going wrong. It was answered the first time by a panel on
 * `/words`, three cards down a page about the deck, which is a list somebody
 * has to find. This is the page it belongs on, and `lib/ux/nav.ts` carries a
 * row for it so the palette goes here too.
 *
 * One query behind this, the round on `/review/flashcards` and the tile on
 * `/practice`, for the reason `lib/progress/cases.ts` gives at length: a
 * shared calculation over an unshared input is not a shared answer, and three
 * screens telling one learner three different things about one word is how a
 * number stops being believed.
 *
 * THE FAVORITES LIVE HERE TOO, AND THEY LEAD.
 *
 * Starring a word has existed since the dictionary did and could be done on
 * one screen and read back on that same screen, which is the screen a learner
 * is least often on: the word worth keeping turns up on a review card. The
 * star is on every card that teaches a word now, and this is where the list
 * of them is, because "which words are mine" and "how are my words going" are
 * the same question asked twice and two pages for them is one page nobody
 * finds. It is the only list here somebody wrote themselves, so it is first.
