/**
 * Every situation the course promises, and where the learner stands on each.
 *
 * "You would understand 81 percent of everyday situations" is the number an
 * app can compute from a word count, and it is the wrong question: knowing
 * the words for a health center is what lets you follow the receptionist,
 * not what lets you answer her. So this page reads each of the course's own
 * claims on three rungs, follow, take part, lead, and says which one the
 * review log actually supports, what the evidence is worth, and what stands
 * in the way. The headline is a distribution and never a percentage.
 *
 * The learner's own level leads and the others follow in course order,
 * because the situations at your level are the ones you meet this week.
