    The wrong answers, and the window they are drawn from.

    `planLesson` below is handed a seed and its header promises the same seed
    gives the same lesson, which was true of everything except the one input
    that decides what the wrong answers are. This query asked for sixty words
    at the unit's level with no `orderBy`, against 478 of them at A1 and 1,302
    at B1, so which sixty was the query plan's choice. Measured rather than
    reasoned about: a bulk touch of the level, which is what re-running
    `npm run harvest` does, swapped seven of the sixty, and the seven that left
    were `Tere hommikust!`, `Aitäh!`, `Palun`, `Head aega!`, `Nägemist!`,
    `kohv` and `elu`, replaced by `järv`, `jalgratas` and `juust`. A learner
    coming back to a lesson would find the same question offering different
    wrong answers, under a comment saying that cannot happen.

    Ordered by lemma alone would fix that and read badly for the same reason
    the grammar reference did: every lesson at a level would draw its decoys
    from the same sixty words at the front of the alphabet, and a learner would
    start recognizing the decoys rather than the answer. So the window starts
    where the unit points, which is the answer `paperFor` reached one file over
    and for the same reason. Seeded on the unit rather than the part, because a
    unit's decoys being one slice is right and `index` is not known this early;
    which of them each question uses is the per-part seed's job, below.
