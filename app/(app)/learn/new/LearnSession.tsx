/**
 * THE LEARN LADDER, DRIVEN.
 *
 * Five words, three rungs each, in one loop. `lib/learn/ladder.ts` says what a
 * rung is and `lib/progress/learn.ts` reads the batch; this asks the questions
 * and sends the grades.
 *
 * WHY A LAP RATHER THAN A LIST. The queue is the batch, and a word that has
 * been answered goes back to the end of it rather than on to its next rung
 * immediately. So a learner meets five words, meets four others in between,
 * and is asked the first one back at the point where they have to retrieve it
 * rather than read it off the screen above. `requeue` is the same helper the
 * review session uses for a missed card and for a first meeting, and the gap
 * it asks for is the batch size, so one lap is one round.
 *
 * EVERY GRADE IS AN ANSWER. Meeting a word writes nothing, exactly as the
 * review screen decided: the card comes back a lap later and *that* retrieval
 * is what the scheduler hears about. Karpicke and Roediger measured the
 * difference at about 80 percent recalled a week later against 35 for learners
 * who only restudied, and the whole of it was whether retrieval happened while
 * the word was being learned.
 *
 * ONE CARD PER WORD, GRADED AT EVERY RUNG. The word's recognition card is what
 * a rung reads and what a rung writes, because each rung asks the same
 * question at a greater depth: what does this word mean, then produce it in a
 * sentence. The word's other cards are Practice's, which is what "moves to
 * practice" means on the screen at the end.

                  This read the other way round: a sentence with a hole in it,
                  its translation, the word, and the question, four blocks of
                  the same weight in four different colors. A learner reported
                  that they could not tell at a glance what was being asked,
                  which is exactly what that order produces. You read the
                  sentence, work out that something is missing, read on to find
                  out which word, and then go back.

                  So it is put the way somebody would say it out loud: here is
                  the word, put it in this sentence. The word leads because it
                  is the one thing on the screen that does not change what it
                  is asking; the instruction is one line under it; and the
                  sentence is the thing to look at while typing, so it sits
                  closest to the box.

                  The gap itself is what the eye should land on inside the
                  sentence, so it keeps the accent and everything else in the
                  line is the ordinary ink. `max-w-md` on both blocks and the
                  spacing carried by one wrapper rather than by whatever margin
                  each element happened to have.

                    ladder: the lemma and the meaning, then the meaning alone,
                    then nothing, because wherever the gap wants the dictionary
                    form the lemma is the answer printed a line above the box.
                    Thirteen cards in the shipped dictionary end up with no
                    hint at all, and "which word goes in this gap" is still a
                    question worth asking, so those lead with the instruction
                    and nothing else. Writing `hint ?? lemma` to fill the space
                    would put the answer back on the screen for exactly those
