          A whole phrase (`Kas sa räägid inglise keelt?`) is taught on the same
          ladder as a word, and for a while that meant "learn 5 new words" could
          hand over five phrases in a row, the entire `tervitused` unit and
          nothing else: a learner pressing "words" expecting words. So a phrase
          is its own quieter button here rather than folded into the count
