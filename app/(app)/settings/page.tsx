  500, and a cap on rows is not a cap on time: measured against a local
  database, where a round trip is nearly free, five hundred rows take about
  two and a half seconds, and a deployment reaches its database over a pooler
  where every one of those round trips costs a great deal more. Without a
  budget the action inherits the platform's default, which on several of them
  is ten seconds, and a paste that runs past it leaves a half-finished import
  and an error that says nothing about how much landed.

  Sixty seconds, the same figure the writing routes use. It is a ceiling rather
