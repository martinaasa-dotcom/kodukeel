/**
 * THE ORDER OF TODAY'S CARDS, AS A LIST WITH TWO ARROWS A ROW.
 *
 * Not drag and drop. A list somebody reorders once a year does not earn a
 * gesture library, a phone's browser takes a long press for its own menu and
 * a drag for a scroll, and a screen reader is told nothing by either. Two
 * buttons a row are one tab stop each, work with a keyboard, and say in words
 * what they did.
 *
 * SAVED ON EVERY MOVE, LIKE EVERY OTHER SETTING HERE. A "Save" button under a
 * list is a second question about a decision already made, and the other
 * panels on this screen all write as they are pressed.
 *
 * THE LINE ABOVE THE CUT IS DRAWN. Today draws the first `TODAY_CARDS` of
 * these, so the position a card is moved to is also what decides whether it
 * is drawn at all, and a rule that decides that silently is a rule somebody
 * discovers by their homework going missing. The rows past the cut say so.
