/**
 * The level the app holds for you, changed by hand.
 *
 * Every other way this app arrives at a level is a measurement, and a
 * measurement is the wrong instrument for at least three ordinary situations.
 * Somebody was moved up in the class they sit in every Tuesday. Somebody sat
 * the real state examination and has the certificate. Somebody read a level
 * check taken on a bad evening and knows it is wrong. Until this button there
 * was no answer to any of them except taking the check again and hoping, and
 * a course that will not listen when you tell it where you are is a course you
 * stop telling things to.
 *
 * It is a row of five chips rather than a card each, because there is nothing
 * to explain per option that the line underneath does not say once, and this
 * is a screen somebody is scanning. What it says out loud is what it changes,
 * since a picker whose effect is invisible reads as decoration: the course
 * opens where you point it, and the words offered in review, practice and the
 * dictionary move with it.
 *
 * `router.refresh()` rather than a local guess about what the server holds.
 * Which level wins is `courseLevelFor`'s decision, not this component's: a
 * fresh level check outranks a choice made before it, and the honest way to
 * show that is to re-render from the answer the server actually gives.
