/**
 * A sponsored group, as the sponsor sees it.
 *
 * Three things are missing from this screen on purpose, and each of them is on
 * the teacher's roster one file over. There is no ranking column, because
 * ordering colleagues by how much homework they did is a league table their
 * employer is reading. There is no weakest case, because an employer has no lesson to plan
 * and "Kadri keeps getting the partitive wrong" follows somebody into a review
 * they never see. And there is no confidence percentage, because a figure that
 * precise about a named employee cannot be argued with by the person it
 * describes. None of the three is hidden here: `workplaceRoster` never reads
 * them, and `CohortSummary` has nowhere to put them.
 *
 * What is left is what somebody paying for this can act on: who is practicing,
 * and who is on track for the paper the group is aiming at.
