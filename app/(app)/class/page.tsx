 * who is keeping up, and students want the week's homework somewhere other than
 * a WhatsApp group. It is built on top of what each learner already owns —
 * a class is a view, never a copy — so joining one shares progress and nothing
 * else, and leaving takes the sharing away without touching a single card.
