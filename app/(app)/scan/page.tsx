 * Turning paper into something you can actually study.
 *
 * Half of a language course lives on paper: a handout, a textbook page, a list
 * copied off a whiteboard. Typing it back in is the step where a learner gives
 * up, so this takes the photograph they were going to take anyway and matches
 * what is on it against the dictionary the app already has.
 *
 * WHAT COMES BACK IS A SET, not a pile of text. A page becomes a named group of
 * words that can be drilled on its own, and its words are references to the
 * shared dictionary in exactly the way a learning-path unit's are, so a
 * correction to a word lands on every page it appears on and a page can never
 * drift out of step with the dictionary.
