    `WeakestCases` down to one component.

            The structure is real. The parts, the timing, the points, the sixty percent you need to
            pass, and a zero on any part failing you outright. Sit one of these and you&apos;ll know
            what the real exam feels like.

            The questions themselves aren&apos;t the real ones, but every word in them is real Estonian,
            straight from the dictionary. The reading part uses real recorded sentences instead of a
            magazine article, and in the speaking part a microphone stands in for the examiner.

            Nothing here scores your pronunciation. We tested a speech recognizer and it
            wasn&apos;t accurate enough, so instead you record yourself, listen back, and judge how
            you did. You&apos;ll see this note again on your result.

            The A1 paper is ours, not the state&apos;s. Estonia doesn&apos;t test at that level, so
            we made it like the A2 paper but a little easier, so your first attempt is one you can
            pass.
