 *
 * Not part of the score, because a model may not decide whether Estonian is
 * correct: the composition's marks came from length and the words the task
 * named, both settled mechanically before this button existed. Anu's note is
 * advice sitting beside a mark she did not award.
 *
 * Not automatic, because it is a paid call and most people sit a paper to see a
 * number rather than to be taught. Asking makes the spend follow the interest.
 *
 * Whatever she says is checked against the dictionary before it is shown: a
 * note that quotes a form nobody can vouch for is withheld whole,
 * which is the same guard the single sentence grader runs behind.
