        WHAT THIS RESULT IS NOT, ON THE SCREEN WHERE SOMEBODY READS A NUMBER
        ABOUT THEMSELVES.

        "The structure of this paper is real" was the whole of it, and it is
        true and it is the half that raises the stakes: a learner who has just
        spent ninety minutes on something headed "Mock state examination" and
        scored 72 reads that sentence as a prediction. The level check has said
        the other half since it was written, in `ResultPanel`: not a
        certificate, and the exams that count are the state ones. The longer
        paper, which looks far more like the real thing, never did.

        Naming the body is the part worth having. Somebody deciding whether to
        book the real examination needs to know who runs it, and somebody
        seeing a result on a screen needs to know this app has nothing to do
        with them. Both sentences are facts about the paper rather than about
        the learner, so they go under the result rather than beside the score.
