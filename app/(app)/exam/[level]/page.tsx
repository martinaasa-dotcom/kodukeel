 * The paper is built here, on the server, from a seed that lives in the URL.
 * That is not a detail: `buildPaper` is deterministic in (level, seed, pool), so
 * a learner who reloads mid-listening gets the paper back rather than a fresh
 * one, and `submitExam` can rebuild the same paper to mark it without the client
 * ever sending the questions or the answers it thinks are right.
 *
 * A visit with no seed is redirected to one carrying a fresh seed, which is what
 * makes "another paper" a link rather than a piece of state.
