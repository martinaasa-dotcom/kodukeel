/**
 * RISTSÕNA: THE DAILY CROSSWORD, ENGLISH CLUES AND ESTONIAN ANSWERS.
 *
 * Named in Estonian for the reason Sõnad is, and the English name is kept
 * beside it rather than dropped: the lead says "a crossword" in the first two
 * words, so nobody has to know the word before they can decide whether to
 * press. That is the shape every grammar screen here takes with a case, the
 * name a class uses leading and the one an English reference grammar uses as
 * the cross-reference.
 *
 * One direction and one direction only, because it is the one that teaches:
 * you know what you mean and you are looking for the word, which is where a
 * learner is every time they open their mouth. A grid the other way round is a
 * reading exercise with extra steps.
 *
 * `lib/games/crossword.ts` compiles it and says what of a crossword is anybody
 * else's, which is the name and the grids and not the format;
 * `lib/progress/crossword.ts` decides which words, from the learner's own band.
