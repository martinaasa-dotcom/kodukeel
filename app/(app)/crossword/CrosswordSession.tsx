/**
 * THE DAILY CROSSWORD'S GRID.
 *
 * A real input per cell rather than one hidden field and a keydown handler,
 * which is the opposite of the choice Sõnad made and is right for the opposite
 * reason. Sõnad is one word at a time with a card of keys under it; this has
 * thirty cells in two directions, so the caret has to be somewhere the reader
 * can see, a phone has to open its own keyboard, and a composed õ has to
 * arrive. An `input` event carries a composition where a `keydown` does not,
 * which is why the letter bar under the grid is the app's own `DiacriticBar`
 * and works here with nothing added: it types into whatever has focus.
 *
 * EMPTY CELLS ARE NOTHING, NOT BLACK SQUARES. A criss-cross is mostly empty by
 * construction, and a nine by nine grid with sixty black squares in it reads as
 * a rendering fault rather than as a puzzle.

            A GROUP RATHER THAN A GRID, WHICH AXE IS RIGHT ABOUT.

            `role="grid"` promises rows: an element with it must hold `row`
            children holding `gridcell` children, and a screen reader offers
            the grid navigation model on the strength of that promise. This is
            one flat CSS grid of cells with no row elements in it, so the
            promise was false and `aria-required-children` fired on it, which
            nothing noticed because the route was not in the accessibility
            suite's list until now.

            Wrapping each row in a `role="row"` with `display: contents` is the
            other fix and buys nothing here: the navigation this actually
            offers is a real `<input>` per cell, each labeled with its own row
            and column, which is what a screen reader user needs and is already
