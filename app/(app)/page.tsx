/**
 * Today. The home dashboard.
 *
 * A page of modules, each answering one question at a glance and each with a
 * way through to the screen that answers it properly: what is due now, what the
 * course does next, what is written down for today, what keeps going wrong, and
 * one word out of the dictionary chosen by the date. A learner should be able
 * to read this page in about fifteen seconds and know what their day looks
 * like, or press one button and start.
 *
 * The modules are declared first and laid out second, further down, which is
 * the shape this file wanted from the beginning: what a card *is* and which
 * column it sits in are two questions, and they were tangled together in one
 * six-hundred-line return statement.
 *
 * What it leads with depends on how far in the learner is — see
 * `lib/ux/disclosure.ts` for the rule and the argument. The short version: this
 * page used to render eleven panels to everybody, and on day one most of them
 * were reporting on an empty review log. A streak of nought, a goal ring at
 * nought percent and a "word to revisit" pulled from a deck nobody has read yet
 * are not information, and somebody meeting the app for the first time had to
 * scroll past all of them to find the one button that matters. Then the same
 * rule was drawn too wide and day one became two cards on an empty page, which
 * is the other way of getting it wrong.
 *
 * Nothing here is deleted for anybody. Every panel a stage holds back is one
 * click away in the rail, in the palette and on its own page.
 *
 * What each card is *about* is the other half of it. The first card used to
 * carry five unrelated things stacked with no headings between them: the due
 * counts, the goal ring, the button, the level bar, the week strip and a note
 * about shields. The streak was a number at the top and its own picture a
 * hundred pixels lower with an XP meter wedged in between, which is one thing
 * told in three places. So the do-now card is now only what to do now, and
 * everything that reports on the run of days is one card that says so.

        beside it as a cross-reference, which is the shape the grammar screens
        take with the Latin case names, and a date is the one place that shape
        buys nothing: the reader already knows what day it is, so the Estonian
        needs no gloss to be read, and printing "Saturday" beside `laupäev`
        answers a question nobody had while taking the guess that teaches the

        ONE CARD ACROSS THE TOP, AND FIVE UNDER IT AT THE MOST.

        The page used to be two columns from the top, the wide one for today
        and the narrow one for what is ahead. That is a sound reading order and
        it made a poor picture, because how much each column holds depends on
        how far in the learner is. So the one card that is not one of several,
        the thing to do now, goes across the whole width, and everything under
        it is handed to `Columns`, which balances the two by height in the
        browser and never splits a card.

        WHAT IS NEW IS THE CAP, AND IT IS THE WHOLE OF THIS PASS. Everything a
        stage allowed was drawn, which on a settled morning was fourteen cards:
        the quest and the game of the day saying "press something short" twice
        over, the sticking points and the weakest cases that Progress already
        draws under their own headings, three quest meters, an XP bar, six
        practice tiles, an exam forecast the hub prints in full, and a standing
        pitch for a tutor whose button is in the corner of every screen. None
        of that is wrong. All of it together is a page somebody scrolls rather
        than reads, on the one screen that has to survive being glanced at from
        a bus stop.

        So the cards are named by slot and the first `TODAY_CARDS` of them are
        drawn, in the learner's own order. The shipped order is the argument:
        what to say to a real person today, what is actually on today, the one
        short round, the run of days, a word, and then the course. It is a
        default rather than a rule, because a home page's reading order is a
        fact about the reader, and Settings is where it is changed; see
        lib/ux/todayOrder.ts. Everything below the cut is on its own page, in
        the rail and in the palette; nothing here is the only way to reach
        anything.

  Which greeting, on the learner's clock rather than the server's. Rendered on

  ALL FOUR ARE GREETINGS A COURSE TEACHES, INCLUDING THE ONE FOR THE SMALL

  about the reader rather than a greeting: it reads as the app noticing the
  hour and having an opinion about it, on the one line that is supposed to be
  the first Estonian somebody meets. `Tere` is what anybody says at an hour
  with no greeting of its own, it is the first phrase in the A1 unit, and it
  is right at every hour, which is what makes it the honest default here.
