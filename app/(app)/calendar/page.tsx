/**
 * THE LEARNER'S OWN ESTONIAN WEEK.
 *
 * Almost everybody using this is also sitting in a class, and until now the two
 * halves of their week lived in different places: the app knew what was due and
 * nothing at all about the Monday evening that produced it. This is the other
 * half, asked for directly: "I have Estonian class on Monday and Wednesday so I
 * want to add that to the built in calendar and then schedule when I do my
 * homework or review on Tuesday and Thursday."
 *
 * ONLY THIS. It is deliberately not a general calendar, and the request said so
 * first: a place to "only keep their estonian calendar events and tasks". A
 * learner's dentist appointment belongs in the calendar they already have.
 *
 * `/tasks` and `/week` were cut in `docs/13-mvp-status.md` §24, and this is not
 * them coming back. Those were a to-do list and a class calendar a teacher set
 * and a learner alone never filled, so they were furniture. This is filled by
 * the person reading it, which is the whole difference.
 *
 * TWO SHAPES OF THING, ONE WEEK. An **event** happens at a time and usually
 * every week, and is `StudyEvent`. A **reminder** is due on a day and is
 * `Task`, which is the row Today already draws and `lib/ux/agenda.ts` already
 * buckets, so a note a learner writes lands where a teacher's assignment does
 * rather than in a second list beside it.
