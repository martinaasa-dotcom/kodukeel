          the whole app sits inside. From `md:` up this is a row, and a flex
          item's automatic minimum is its min-content width, so anything wide
          in a page (a table of forms, a row of chips that will not wrap) made
          `main` wider than the window rather than being contained by it. The
          body clips sideways, so the overflow did not even leave a scrollbar
          to find it with: the right-hand end of the page was simply gone.
          Below `md:` this is a column and the question never arose, which is
