/**
 * SÕNAD'S BOARD.
 *
 * Circles rather than squares, the app's own three hues rather than green,
 * yellow and gray, and its own movements. `lib/games/sonad.ts` says what is
 * owned by whom and why none of that is an accident.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS IN THE BROWSER AND THE SCORE IS NOT. Marking a guess without a
 * round trip is most of how this feels to play, so the word crosses; what a
 * finished round is worth is decided on the server from the guesses, so a
 * forged board cannot post a Good for a word nobody answered. See
 * `lib/progress/sonad.ts`.
 *
 * THE KEYS ARE AN ESTONIAN KEYBOARD, WHICH IS NOT THE ESTONIAN ALPHABET, and
 * which of those it is lives in `lib/games/sonad.ts` beside the rule about
 * which letters a guess may hold: a keyboard missing one of them looks exactly
 * like a keyboard, so the pairing is tested rather than remembered. What is
 * decided here is only how wide a key is drawn, which is a fact about a phone.
 *
 * It doubles as the record of what each letter turned out to be, which is why
 * it is on the page at all rather than leaving a phone to its own keyboard.
 */

/**
 * WHAT EACH OF THE THREE LOOKS LIKE, AND WHY COLOR IS NOT ALL OF IT.
 *
 * The design system's rule is that a color may never be the only thing
 * carrying a distinction, and this board is the exact case it is written for.
 * The first version was mint, butter's tint and `--raised`, which in the light
 * theme is a strong green beside two pale washes: the two that matter most to
 * tell apart, "in the word somewhere" and "not in the word at all", differed by
 * hue alone. That is unreadable to about one man in twelve and hard for anybody
 * on a phone in daylight.
 *
 * So the three are three different *kinds of object* and the hue is the second
 * signal rather than the only one.
 *
 *   here       a solid fill and no ring. The letter is settled.
 *   elsewhere  a tint with a ring round it. In play, and not placed.
 *   absent     a flat wash, no ring, a muted letter. Spent.
 *
 * The ring is the part that is not color, and it is what tells `elsewhere`
 * from `absent` for somebody who cannot see the difference between a pale
 * cream and a pale lavender. Its first draft dropped the fill as well, on the
 * argument that an outline says "in play" better than a wash does, and that
 * measured 3.52:1 in the light theme: `--butter-ink` is drawn to sit on
 * butter's tint and not on the card. Measured in a browser rather than reasoned
 * about from the token list, in both themes, which is the rule.
 *
 * A HUE HAS A FILL AND AN INK AND THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. `--on-mint` is
 * the ink for mint's *solid* fill, which is the one the palette has and the one
 * the week strip's tick needed. `--butter-ink` is the ink for butter and is
 * what the ring and the letter inside it are drawn in, on the ordinary card
 * ground, which is a pairing the palette already defines. Inventing an
 * `--on-butter` from inside a game to make the three look symmetrical would be
 * adding a token to a design system sideways.

        the board on a desktop, which is where it reads anyway.

        Drawn from the same `HUE` and `RING` tables the circles are, so a
