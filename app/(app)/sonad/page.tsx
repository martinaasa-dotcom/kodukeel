/**
 * SÕNAD: ONE ESTONIAN WORD A DAY, SIX LETTERS, SIX GUESSES.
 *
 * `lib/games/sonad.ts` holds the rules and the argument about what is anybody
 * else's; `lib/progress/sonad.ts` holds which word today is and which words it
 * will accept. This page is the join, and the two reads it needs are asked at
 * once because neither depends on the other.
 *
 * The word is banded on the learner's level, so the pool follows them up and
 * nobody is asked to deduce a C1 noun in their first week. The guess list is
 * the whole language, because refusing a real Estonian word is the one thing a
 * game like this must never do, and it is handed to the browser rather than
 * checked over the wire: a round trip per guess is a round trip inside the one
 * gesture the game is made of.
