/**
 * Audio multiple-choice — the Duolingo "listening exercise" idea, built as a
 * session mode over existing RECOGNITION cards (see app/review/sprint/ for
 * the same pattern) rather than a new stored CardType. docs/13-mvp-status.md
 * §4 shelved a real `LISTENING` FSRS card because it would need example
 * sentences the dictionary doesn't carry for every word; this sidesteps that
 * by only ever needing what every word already has — its audio and its
 * translation — and grading through the same FSRS path as a normal review.
 *
 * Always renders ListeningSession, even with an empty card pool — it decides
 * for itself, once on mount, whether to show its own empty state. gradeCard()
 * refreshes this route's Server Component on every call, so a conditional
 * choice made *here* between Empty and ListeningSession would keep
 * re-evaluating as the pool is graded away, swapping to Empty right as the
 * final card is graded — before the session summary would show.
