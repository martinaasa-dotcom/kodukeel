 * palette is a pair: the fill is what a bar or a button is painted, the tint is
 * what a panel is painted, and each has an ink drawn to sit on its own tint
 * (docs/14-design-system.md). `--butter` is the fill, #cf9114, so the box was a
 * slab of gold with body text set in a color chosen for a white card; in the
 * dark theme `--butter` is #ffcd6e and `--butter-ink` resolves to the same
 * value, so the heading was bright yellow on bright yellow. Every other
 * feedback panel in the app was already right: the cloze round, listening,
 * sprint and pairs all paint `<hue>-soft` and write in `<hue>-ink`.
 *
 * AND THREE OUTCOMES RATHER THAN TWO, because the round already knew about
 * three. `markFlash` returns a middle rating for the right word in the wrong
 * ending, which is the near miss this round exists to catch, and the screen
 * flattened it into the same box as a blank. The palette has one color for
 * "nearly" and one for "missed" and they mean exactly those two things, so the
 * box now says which without anybody reading a word. It says it in words too,
 * since a hue is never the only thing carrying a distinction here.
