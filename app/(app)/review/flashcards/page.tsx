/**
 * FLASH CARDS: THE WORDS YOU HAVE MET, ASKED IN A WAY REVIEW DOES NOT ASK THEM.
 *
 * `/practice` used to open with a tile linking back to `/review`, which is the
 * page most people arrive from. The learner asked for that slot to hold
 * something that does work review does not, and the first answer to that was
 * this round rendering `ReviewSession` over a different queue, which is review
 * again: the same four shapes, drawn from another list. Their report was that
 * it "reverts back to what is in the Review section", and it did.
 *
 * `lib/games/flash.ts` is the round proper. Five shapes rather than four, and
 * three of them are things review cannot ask: a sentence heard and never
 * shown, a gap with the meaning rather than the lemma beside it, and a
 * sentence the learner writes themselves around a named form. Typed
 * throughout, because producing a form is a different memory from picking it
 * out of four and picking is what stops telling you anything about a word that
 * is nearly known.
 *
 * WHAT IT DRAWS. Words that are not mastered, hardest first, and for each one
 * a slot it has not been right in yet. `Verdict.filled` is what makes that
 * possible: mastery counts distinct slots, so the round can ask for the ones
 * missing rather than piling a sixth correct answer into a slot already full.
 * A word right five times as a meaning is asked for its kaasaütlev instead.
 *
 * WHY IT IS STILL A REVIEW. Every mode grades through the same log (ADR-016),
 * so the scheduler sees what was practiced and this is not a side score. What
 * is new is that the answer says which form it was about: the round asks for
 * kaasaütlev on a card that may be a recognition card, and without
 * `Review.slot` the log would record the answer as being about a meaning and
 * the variety half of mastery would never move. See `lib/srs/slots.ts`.
