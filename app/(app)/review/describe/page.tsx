/**
 * SAY WHAT YOU SEE: A PICTURE, AND ONE SENTENCE OF YOUR OWN ABOUT IT.
 *
 * The feedback asked for a picture to describe and for a conversation to hold.
 * They are the same exercise with different scenery, and this is it: a
 * situation, three things in it, and the learner producing Estonian rather
 * than recalling the back of a card.
 *
 * ONLY ONE OF THE THREE WORDS IS NAMED, and that is the whole reason the
 * picture is worth having. The named one carries the case the task asks for,
 * so the requirement is unambiguous and the marking is certain. The other two
 * are pictures and nothing else: knowing them is worth credit, not knowing
 * them still leaves something to write about, and both are revealed with their
 * glosses once the sentence has been marked. Naming all three up front would
 * make the picture decoration.
 *
 * Nothing here ships artwork. The things are emoji, which are characters drawn
 * by the reader's own font, joined to dictionary headwords by
 * `scripts/build-emoji.ts` against Unicode's own data file. See
 * `lib/collections/scenes.ts` for why that is the answer rather than a
 * shortcut to one.
