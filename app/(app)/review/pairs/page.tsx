    Around the learner's level, and ordered at all.

    This cap binds: the dictionary is around six thousand words and the pairs
    are discovered by collapsing doubled letters across all of them, so which
    two thousand were looked at decided which contrasts existed. Unordered,
    that was the plan's choice, and a drill could offer a pair one day and not
    the next.

    `ORDER BY cefr ASC` fixed the order and pinned the pool to the bottom of
    the dictionary at the same time, which nothing said out loud: two thousand
    rows starting at A1 is A1, A2 and most of B1, so a C1 speaker opening this
    got beginner contrasts on their first visit and on their four hundredth.
    The band is the learner's own now, one either side of where they are
    (`lib/collections/levels.ts`), and the cefr key stays in the order because
    within a window the easier contrast is still the better one to open on.

    It widens rather than empties. A window too thin to find pairs in is a
    fact about the deployment's dictionary rather than about the learner, so
    the whole graded set answers instead, which is what this drill did for
    everybody before.
