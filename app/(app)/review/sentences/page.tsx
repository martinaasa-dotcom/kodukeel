 * Builds a round of sentence-ordering exercises from the learner's own deck.

 * Every sentence is one Ekilex recorded against a word they are already
 * studying, so the vocabulary is familiar and only the word order is being
 * tested. Sentences that already have an English translation come first: with
 * one, the exercise is "say this in Estonian", which is a genuine production
 * task rather than a memory drill.
 *
 * Always renders SentenceSession, even with nothing to do — the same reason as
 * every other mode (see app/review/sprint/page.tsx): grading refreshes this
 * Server Component, and a conditional empty state here would swap in mid-round.
