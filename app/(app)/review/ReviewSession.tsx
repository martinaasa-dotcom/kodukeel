    a wrong word, and names the case the learner reached for instead. All of

    those cards into a flip with "Not yet" and "Got it" under it. So the app

    readiness rungs and the exam confidence figure are all derived from, so a
    number this app presents as measured was partly self-reported. The

    rather than to hand the marking back.

            A `CASE_FORM` card's front is `tuba → milles? kus?` and its hint
            is `seesütlev · the inessive`, which is the naming rule this app

            worth more here. So the plain sentence goes between the two: the
            question stays where it was, the name stays where it was, and

            WHO DECIDES WHETHER THE ANSWER WAS RIGHT.

            Four buttons used to sit here on every card in the app, and on most
            of them they were asking a question the app had already answered.
            `checkAnswer` compares what was typed against a form the dictionary
            vouches for and returns the rating to use; a multiple choice is
            right or it is not. The screen took that verdict, drew a ring round
            one of the four buttons, and waited for somebody to press it anyway.

            So the rule is: the app marks what it can mark, and the learner is
            asked only about what it cannot. A flip card is the one shape with
            nothing to compare, and there it is two buttons rather than four,
            because "how well did that go" has two honest answers and the middle
            two were guesses about a scheduler nobody can see.

            RATINGS still carries all four values and `submit` still takes any
            of them: the log, undo and the offline replay are unchanged, and
            Hard is still what a near miss is graded. What went is the asking.
