 * and overdue cards are favored, since fast repetition on exactly those is where
 * a timer earns its keep.
 *
 * Always renders SprintSession, even with an empty pool: SprintSession decides
 * for itself, once on mount, whether to show its own empty state. Server
 * Actions like gradeCard() refresh this route's Server Component on every
 * call, so a conditional Empty-vs-Session choice made *here* would keep
 * re-evaluating as the pool is graded away — and swap to Empty right as the
 * final card is graded, right before the session summary would show.
