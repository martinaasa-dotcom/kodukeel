/**
 * THE FOUR LISTS, AS FOUR ROUNDS.
 *
 * `/dictionary/common` is the same four lists as lists: what is on them, in
 * order, with a button that collects a hundred words cheaply. This is the other
 * question about them, which is what to do with them, and the answer is a round
 * per list.
 *
 * Both exist because they are genuinely two things. Reading the hundred
 * commonest verbs is worth doing once; working through them twenty at a time,
 * asked in a different form each morning, is worth doing for a month. The
 * dictionary's page links here and this links back, so neither is a dead end.
 *
 * It carries the counts because they are the one thing that decides which list
 * to press, and `/practice` deliberately does not: that card is four buttons on
 * a page that already asks five questions of the database, and a number nobody
 * is choosing by is not worth a query on the screen somebody opens every day.
