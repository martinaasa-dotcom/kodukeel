/**
 * ONE PRESS, THE NEXT TWENTY WORDS OF A LIST, BUILT OUT PROPERLY.
 *
 * The round asks the words a learner already has cards for, so a list nobody
 * has added is a round with nothing in it. This is the way out of that, and it
 * is a button rather than something the page does on arrival for a reason
 * worth writing down: `PrefetchLink` fetches a whole page once a pointer has
 * settled on a link for 90ms, so a page that wrote cards while rendering would
 * build somebody a deck for hovering over it.
 *
 * It reports what happened in its own line rather than revalidating the list
 * out from under the cursor, which is the shape `/admin/suggestions` settled
 * on: a row that vanishes with no word about whether it worked is worse than
 * a slower one that says.
