/**
 * FLASH CARDS OVER ONE OF THE FREQUENCY LISTS.
 *
 * `/review/flashcards` is the whole deck; this is the same round pointed at a
 * hundred words the corpus says a learner will meet most. The two share
 * everything that matters: `ReviewSession` renders it, `withChoices` fills it,
 * `leastPractisedSlot` decides which card of a word to ask, and every answer
 * grades through `gradeCard` like any other (ADR-016). A fourth copy of a card
 * runner is how undo, the offline outbox, the rating keys and the letter bar
 * stop being one implementation.
 *
 * WHY IT ASKS DIFFERENT FORMS RATHER THAN MEANINGS. `deepenCommonWords` builds
 * these words out into every card type they support, so a noun on this list
 * carries its cases and a verb its persons, and `leastPractisedSlot` then hands
 * back the slot the learner has been asked in least. So `saama` comes up as a
 * meaning once and after that as `olevik · ta`, and `aeg` as `millesse? kuhu?`
 * rather than as "time" for the fifth time.
 *
 * TWO DIFFERENCES FROM FLASH CARDS, AND BOTH ARE THE POINT.
 *
 * It does not filter to words that have been met. Flash cards is "the words you
 * have met, asked in a way you have not", so a card in state 0 is not its
 * business; this round is somebody deciding to work a named list, and the words
 * on it are new by construction the first time. A new card still opens with its
 * first meeting, which is `withChoices` and `askFor` doing what they already do.
 * `notOnLadder` still applies, though: a first meeting is the plain word and its
 * gloss, and a word whose recognition card has not graduated may not be asked
 * for a case or a conjugated form instead, which is a different word's worth of
 * memory (see `pastTheLadder`, one file over).
 *
 * And it does not filter to words that are unmastered. A hundred words is a
 * list you come back to, and a mastered word simply sorts to the back of a
 * query ordered by lapses and by when it is due, which is FSRS deciding rather
 * than this file.
