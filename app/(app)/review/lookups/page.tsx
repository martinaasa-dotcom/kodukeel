/**
 * THE WORDS THE LEARNER WENT AND GOT, ASKED ON THEIR OWN.
 *
 * Reported by somebody using the app, and the report was right about the
 * mechanism as well as the symptom. A word looked up out of curiosity goes into
 * one deck with everything else, and the review queue introduces unseen cards
 * oldest first: sixty read, ordered by band, ten shown. So a word looked up on
 * the bus this afternoon sits behind the whole course backlog, and on a deck
 * built by adding a level in first run that backlog is a year long. The word
 * somebody was interested enough to stop and look up is the last one the app
 * gets round to teaching.
 *
 * Anki has the opposite failure and it is worth saying which of the two this
 * is, because the fixes point in opposite directions. There, everything a
 * learner adds lands at the front and a queue fills with rare words they met
 * once; here nothing a learner adds ever reaches the front at all. Two answers
 * came out of that. `commonFirst` puts the words the corpus counts most ahead
 * of the ones it has never heard of inside each band, so the trickle is not
 * assembly order any more. And this is the other half: a round that asks only
 * about the words that were the learner's own idea, so they are reachable in
 * one press rather than by waiting their turn.
 *
 * NOT A SECOND DECK, AND NOT A SECOND SCHEDULER. `lib/srs/` holds one deck and
 * one queue, and a card in this round is the same row it was, graded through
 * `gradeCard` like every other mode (ADR-016), with its FSRS state carried
 * along. What separates them is `Card.source` and a `where` clause, which is
 * exactly what `/review/common` does with the frequency lists. A second table
 * of cards would be a second answer to when a word is known.
 *
 * `leastPractisedSlot` picks which card of a word to ask, so a word that has
 * been asked for its meaning four times comes back as `millesse? kuhu?`, and
 * `withChoices` opens a word nobody has met yet with its first meeting, both of
 * which are the ordinary behavior of every round in this directory. `notOnLadder`
 * is the third: a word a learner has just looked up may still be a case or a
 * conjugated form ahead of its own recognition card graduating, and this round
 * may not hand that out as the first thing they are asked about it.
