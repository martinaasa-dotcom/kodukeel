/**
 * THE DRILL FOR THE WORDS THE ENDING RULE DOES NOT REACH.
 *
 * `/grammar/exceptions` is the list and this is what to do with it, which is
 * the split `/dictionary/common` and `/review/common` already make: reading a
 * list of unpredictable forms teaches nobody one.
 *
 * WHICH WORDS. Banded to the learner's level, deck first. Government's drill
 * makes the same argument about the same thing one route over: a word met for
 * the first time in a drill that explains the answer is a reasonable way to
 * learn it, and a word already in the deck is the one where answering is
 * evidence the scheduler should see. `?kind=` narrows it, which is what the
 * button on each kind's own page sends.
 *
 * WHAT IT GRADES. The learner's own card for the word, where they hold one,
 * carrying the slot that was actually asked, so the illative somebody cannot
 * produce here lands in the same weakest-case chart as the illative they cannot
 * produce on a card (ADR-016). A word with no card writes nothing, which is the
 * answer `/review/emoji` gives about the same situation: there is no schedule
 * to move.
 *
 * The sentences are read through `naturalSentencesFor`, the deck's own reader,
 * because what counts as a sentence is one answer for the whole app and a
 * second copy of it is where two screens start disagreeing.
