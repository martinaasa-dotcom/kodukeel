 * you are about to forget is worth more than on one you met this morning. A
 * word whose sentence already has an English translation is asked as the
 * sentence instead: producing "Jõin tassi kohvi." out loud is a different and
 * harder skill than producing "kohv", and by this point in a session the
 * learner has usually earned it.
