 * and stays.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO ENGLISH ON THE SCREEN. The emoji is the meaning, so the word
 * side is free to be a case form with the question it answers over it: `kus?`
 * over `majas`. That is the whole reason this round is not a vocabulary round.
 * A learner reading `kus? majas` beside 🏠 has confirmed the word and the ending
 * in one move.
 *
 * IT GRADES WHAT IT CAN. Every mode writes to the review log (ADR-016) so the
 * scheduler sees what was actually practiced, and this one does too: a pair
 * drawn from the learner's own deck is graded on the match. Found first time is
 * a recognition and grades Good; found after a wrong try grades Hard, which is
 * what a near miss is graded everywhere else in this app.
 *
 * A pair drawn from the dictionary to fill the board carries no card and is not
 * graded, because there is nothing to grade: only 313 nouns have a picture, so
 * a beginner's deck cannot fill six pairs on its own. That is a gap in the
 * board rather than an exemption from the rule.
