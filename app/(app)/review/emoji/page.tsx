 * PICTURE MATCH: THE MEANING IS THE PICTURE, SO THE WORD CAN BE A CASE FORM.
 *
 * The visual-memory round, asked for as "matching words only to pictures... this
 * reinforces the memory of the word and keeps it very fun".
 *
 * WHAT THE PICTURE BUYS IS THE CASE. An emoji carries the meaning without a
 * word of English, and that is not only a nicety: it frees the Estonian side of
 * the pair to be something other than the dictionary form. So a tile is a
 * question word over a case form, `kus?` over `majas`, and the board is
 * Estonian throughout. A learner matching 🏠 to `majas` has to know the word
 * *and* read the ending, which is the difference between this and a
 * vocabulary round.
 *
 * Where a word's stems will not build a case, the tile is the lemma alone
 * rather than a guess. `caseAnswer` is the one function that answers "what is
 * this word in this case", it prefers an attested form over a derived one, and
 * it returns null rather than inventing (ADR-005).
 *
 * NOUNS ONLY, because `lib/collections/emoji.ts` is nouns only: a picture of a
 * thing is a picture of a noun, and the first run of that join matched
 * `helistama`, which means to telephone, against 💍. See `scripts/build-emoji.ts`.
 *
 * The emoji are characters rather than artwork, drawn by the reader's own font,
 * so nothing is shipped and no license is carried.

    THE LEARNER'S OWN CARDS FIRST, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES THIS A PRACTICE MODE.

    Every mode grades through `gradeCard` (ADR-016) so the scheduler sees what
    was actually practiced, and a round that only ever drew from the dictionary
    would be a side game with a score of its own. So the board is filled from
    the learner's own case cards wherever it can be: a matched pair is a
    recognition of that exact form, and it is graded.

    It cannot always be filled that way. Only 313 nouns carry a picture, which
    is about six percent of the dictionary, so a beginner's deck of forty words
    holds two or three of them and a board needs six. The rest come from the
    dictionary at the learner's level, and those carry no card because there is
    no card: nothing is graded for them, which is the honest answer rather than
    a row about a card that does not exist.

    ASKED AT ONCE, because the two do not need each other: the level decides
    which band the board tops up from and the deck read does not wait on it.
    On the deployment's own pooler each `await` is a round trip, so a page that
    lines them up is a round trip longer than it has to be for nothing.
