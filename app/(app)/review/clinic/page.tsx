      Cheap and orthographic: it only ever claims "these look alike". Ordered,

      that comes and goes with the plan.

      And ordered to the end, which that sentence claimed and the query did not
      do: `addCardsFor` writes a word's recognition and production cards in one
      `createMany`, so they carry the same `createdAt` to the millisecond, and
      the cut at the thousandth row fell wherever the plan left the tie. The
