          Most review apps quietly bury a card like this once you have got it wrong enough times.
          That clears your queue, but you never learn the word. Here you can see how each one is
          going wrong: steadily, or after a good run, or back and forth. That is usually enough to
          know what to do about it. Deleting a card never touches its history, and nothing in that
          log is ever changed or removed.

/**
 * The failure history as a strip, oldest on the left.
 *
 * A FAILURE AND A RECALL ARE DIFFERENT SHAPES, NOT JUST DIFFERENT HUES.
 *
 * They were peach and mint squares with a `title` on each, and CLAUDE.md
 * already says what is wrong with that in the dictation drill: a color may
 * not be the only thing carrying a distinction, and a tooltip is not text.
 * The `aria-hidden` and the `sr-only` line below meant a screen reader was
 * fine; somebody who simply cannot separate those two hues, on a phone where
 * no tooltip exists, had a row of identical squares. Telling a failure from a
 * recall is the whole of what this strip is for.
 *
 * A failure is full height and a recall is a third of it, which is the
 * sparkline idiom and reads at 10 pixels. The hues stay, because they are
 * right and because two signals are better than one.
 *
 * And the count is visible rather than only announced. It was already written
 * for a screen reader; there was no reason the person looking at the strip
 * could not have it too.
