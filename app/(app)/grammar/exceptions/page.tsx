/**
 * THE PAGE THAT SAYS HOW FAR TO TRUST THE PATTERN.
 *
 * `/grammar` opens with "three you memorize, and eleven you can work out",
 * which is true and is the most motivating fact a beginner is given. What no
 * screen said is where it stops: `caseAnswer` prefers an attested form over the
 * rule, so a learner meets `tuppa` printed under a heading that taught them
 * `sse` and has no way to know which of the two facts is the one to reach for
 * tomorrow. That is worse than not knowing, because the pattern is presented as
 * more reliable than it is.
 *
 * Nothing on this page is a list somebody typed. `lib/estonian/exceptions.ts`
 * states the pattern per slot and reports the words whose stored form disagrees,
 * so the page is a reading of the dictionary and cannot drift from it. The
 * counts are counted for the same reason: a number written into a paragraph is
 * a number nobody re-measures, and the whole argument here is a proportion.
 *
 * BANDED, because the value of this area is that it is small. A learner at A1
 * has no use for the polite imperative of a C1 verb, and the whole set is a
 * click away on each kind's own page.
