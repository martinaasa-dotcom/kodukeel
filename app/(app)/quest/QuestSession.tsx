/**
 * THE DAILY QUEST.
 *
 * Two minutes by default, self-graded by comparison, on the cards behind the
 * cases this learner is worst at. It is the one round that opens by saying what
 * it is about: "your seesütlev is at 54%" is the reason to press it, and a round
 * that hid that would be another timer. How long the clock runs is the
 * learner's, resolved on the server from `lib/ux/roundClock.ts`: a fixed limit
 * is WCAG 2.2.1 failed, and somebody who reads slowly was shut out of this
 * round rather than playing a harder one.
 *
 * A PICK RATHER THAN A TYPED ANSWER, deliberately. Two minutes at a typed
 * answer is about eight cards, and the point of this round is volume across a
 * weakness rather than depth on one card; the same argument the Case Sprint
 * makes.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT DELIBERATE IS THE LEARNER MARKING THEIR OWN PAPER, and this
 * round used to. It showed the answer and asked "Had it?" or "Missed it?", and
 * that verdict went into `Review`, which is append-only and is what
 * `caseAccuracy` reads back to decide which cases are weak. This round chooses
 * its cards *by* that reading, so the panel picking the cards was being fed by
 * the round claiming to fix them, on the learner's own say-so, and every
 * figure downstream of it — the weakest-case panel, the mastery counter, the
 * readiness rungs, the exam confidence percentage — was presented as measured.
 *
 * The volume argument never required that. Picking one of four forms of the
 * same word is a tap, exactly as "Had it" was a tap, and it is a measurement:
 * the wrong answers are `toast`, `toasse` and `toale` against `toas`, which is
 * the confusion this round exists for. A wrong pick also says which case the
 * learner reached for, which goes into `Review.reachedSlot` and which no flip
 * could ever have known (`lib/questions/caseChoices.ts`).
 *
 * A card that cannot be given options is still a flip, because there is then
 * genuinely nothing to compare, and `SELF_GRADES` is what makes that honest
 * (`lib/srs/scheduler.ts`).
 *
 * Every answer grades through `gradeCard`, so a round played for the timer
 * still moves the schedule and the log records what happened (ADR-016). An
 * abandoned round writes only the cards actually answered, which is what the
 * log should say.
