/**
 * TWO MINUTES ON WHATEVER IS GOING WRONG.
 *
 * The one round that is not about the schedule. Review asks what is due and
 * Flash cards asks what is not yet solid; this asks the narrower question a
 * learner wants answered on a day they have five minutes: where do I stand on
 * the things I keep getting wrong.
 *
 * It is aimed at cases rather than at words, which is the design decision worth
 * naming. A deck's failures cluster by grammar: nobody fails `tuba` and `kool`
 * for unrelated reasons, they fail the seesütlev on both. See
 * `lib/progress/quest.ts` for how the pool is drawn.
 *
 * Grades through `gradeCard` like every other mode (ADR-016), so a round played
 * for the timer still moves the schedule and the log records what happened.
