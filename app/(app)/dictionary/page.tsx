    Somebody who heard `poiss` writes "pois", somebody who heard `padi` writes
    "pati", and the search folds diacritics and case endings and has nothing to
    say about either.

      - A real Estonian word the dictionary has no entry for. The screen can

        this app's own copy and searching for it returned nothing at all.
      - A misspelling of one. Offer it.
      - Neither, in which case the blank really is the answer.

    One file read and one indexed query, and only on the path that was going
    to be a dead end.
