/**
 * THE HUNDRED YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF LEARNING FIRST, IN FOUR LISTS.
 *
 * Four rather than one, because a hundred nouns and a hundred verbs are two
 * different things to sit down with, and because a nominal and a verb are
 * counted differently upstream: ranking them against each other would be
 * comparing two measurements. See `scripts/build-frequency.ts`.
 *
 * The small words lead, and that is the argument the page is making. They are
 * the commonest words in the language by a long way, they are the ones a
 * course leaves until the grammar needs them, and they are what makes a
 * sentence heard on a bus turn into a sentence understood. `ei`, `et`, `ja`,
 * `kui`, `kas`, `jah` and `aga` are the first seven, and none of them is a
 * noun anybody would have thought to look up.
 *
 * Closed to start, with the counts on the summary, for the reason the mastery
 * lists are: four hundred words unrolled on a page is a wall, and the number
 * is the part that gets read first.
