/**
 * WHICH WORDS ARE WORTH LEARNING FIRST, ANSWERED BY COUNTING RATHER THAN BY
 * OPINION.
 *
 * The course teaches in themes and the dictionary holds six thousand words,
 * and neither answers the question somebody asks in their first week. This
 * does, out of a published count over a corpus of film and television
 * subtitles, gated through the dictionary so every word on the page is one the
 * app can teach. `scripts/build-frequency.ts` is the whole of how, including
 * why the source is the one with a share-alike license rather than the better
 * corpus with a non-commercial one.
 *
 * The page says which corpus, in the lead, because "the most common words in
 * Estonian" is a claim this cannot make: subtitles are dialogue, so `tere` and
 * `aitäh` rank high and the vocabulary of a newspaper leader does not. That is
 * the right corpus for somebody learning to talk to people and the page has to
 * say so rather than let a reader assume otherwise.
