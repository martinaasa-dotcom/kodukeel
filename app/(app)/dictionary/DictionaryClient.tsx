    A PRONOUN DECLINES LIKE A NOUN AND WAS GETTING NO TABLE AT ALL.

    `see`, `kes` and `mina` are among the first thirty words anybody learns and
    are looked up constantly, and this screen showed them three forms and
    stopped, where `raamat` gets fourteen. The exclusion looks deliberate and
    was not: `PRONOUN` arrived as a part of speech long after this line, and
    the objection it might have been written for is about cards rather than
    tables. A card compares one answer, so a pronoun card answering `minule`
    marks `mulle` wrong, which is why the pronoun unit sets its own card types
    and builds none. A table has no such problem.

    And the forms are right, measured rather than assumed: `npm run
    audit:cases` puts every case this derives to Ekilex for every nominal in
    the dictionary, pronouns included, and every slot matches the form the
    Institute lists first. `see` gives `sellesse`, `sellel`, `nendega`; `kes`
    gives `kellele`, `kelleta`. The short forms Estonian also has (`mulle`,
    `sel`, `neis`) are parallel variants of exactly the kind `raamatuis` is,
    and they appear on an entry that has been enriched, through the retrieved
    table above. Where the entry has not been enriched, the note under the
    table says they exist rather than leaving a beginner to assume they do not.
