  So a learner who chose dark got a full frame of the light palette on every
  single page load: a white flash, at whatever hour somebody who chose dark is
  most likely to be reviewing.

  There is no way to read `localStorage` from the server, so the only thing
  that can answer before paint is a blocking inline script. It is three lines,
  it runs once, and `suppressHydrationWarning` on <html> is what lets it write
  an attribute React did not render without React objecting on arrival.

  Nothing stored means nothing written, and bare `:root` in globals.css is the
  light palette, which is the default for everybody: the system's own dark
  setting is deliberately not read. A `try` around it because Safari throws on
  `localStorage` outright in private browsing rather than returning null, and
  a theme is not worth a blank page.
