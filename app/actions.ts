    READ AND WRITE UNDER ONE LOCK, BECAUSE "IS IT ALREADY THERE" IS CHECK-THEN-ACT.

    This read the learner's existing cards for the word, filtered the generated
    ones against them, and inserted the rest. Two requests inside that gap both
    see an empty deck and both insert. Measured against a real database, firing
    the same shape concurrently: two adds gave two cards, four gave four, and
    eight gave fourteen where two is right. A learner meets it by
    double-tapping "Add to deck", and `addUnitToDeck` walks this once per word
    with no throttle in front of it, so one impatient second on a nineteen-word
    unit is the worst case rather than the unlikely one.

    The answer is `lib/usage/ledger.ts`'s, for the reasons its own header gives:
    a *transaction* advisory lock, so a connection pooler cannot strand it, and
    the blocking form, since the non-blocking one serializes nothing.

    The key is `lockDeck`'s and is the learner rather than the learner and the
    word, which is a widening this path did not need on its own and the batched
    builder does. A key naming the word is safe against another add of the same
    word and says nothing about `addUnitsToDeck` writing a unit that contains
    it, so two keys would leave each path guarded against itself and neither
    against the other. One definition, in `lib/srs/deck.ts`, because two spellings
    of a lock key are a lock that is not held.

    Held across one select and one insert, which is milliseconds, and the whole
    of it is work this action was doing anyway.

    A unique index would be the other answer and is the one not taken: an
    existing deck that already holds duplicates from this bug would fail the

    ASKED ONCE FOR THE WHOLE PASTE, NOT ONCE PER LINE.

    This ran a `findUnique` and then usually a `create` for every row, and the
    cap is five hundred of them. Measured against a real database, and a local
    one where a round trip is nearly free: five hundred rows took 3.8 seconds,
    of which the lookup was 13% and the creation 18%. Both are the same
    question asked five hundred times, and `@@unique` on `(lemma, pos)` means
    one `IN` over the lemmas answers all of it.

    What is left per row is `addCardsFor`, which is half the cost and stays
    per word: it takes a lock and reads that word's existing cards, and
    collapsing that would mean a second path that writes cards, which is the
    one thing this file should not grow. The route's own time budget is what
    covers the rest; see `maxDuration` in `app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`.

    Deduplicated by `(lemma, pos)` after capping, which the per-row version got
    for free by asking the database again for each row and finding what the row
    before it had just written. Two lines can be the same because somebody
    assembled a list from two handouts, or because capping a long lemma made
    them the same.

    What that costs if it is missed is not the write, which `skipDuplicates`
    below handles: it is the counting. `skipped` collects a lemma per row that
    was already there, so a repeated line reports one word as two, and a paste
    of a new word plus a repeated old one reads "Skipped 2 you already had"
    about a single word. Measured rather than assumed, and the first check
    written for this asserted the created count, which is 1 either way and so
    could not fail.

  answer in both rounds grades through it (ADR-016), so a count is there, but
  the grades are in flight when the round ends and go to the outbox entirely
