 * WHY A PAGE AND NOT A PARAGRAPH IN THE README. Three kinds of reader end up
 * asking the same question from different directions. Somebody at a ministry
 * wants to know they are not underwriting a company's margin. A university
 * wants to know what happens to the work when the money stops. A company's
 * community budget wants to know the number is real and small. All three are
 * asking "what am I actually paying for", and the honest answer is an itemized
 * list with the arithmetic left in.
 *
 * A learner is a fourth reader and the one this page is most careful with. An
 * app for people whose data is the reason they are careful has to be able to
 * say where its money comes from, because "free" is the word that should make
 * somebody ask what is being sold. Nothing is. `/privacy` says that and this
 * page shows the bill that makes it possible.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM A PITCH. Every number is either measured on
 * this repository, quoted off a vendor's price list with the date it was read,
 * or named as an assumption the reader can change. The interactive part is not
 * decoration: a total somebody can move is a total they can check, and the
 * three least flattering findings on the page (that the bill is about three
 * hundred dollars a month before a single learner arrives, that speech is the
 * fastest-growing line once anybody puts a figure on it, and that what is
 * given to this app outgrows what it pays for) are all things the model
 * surfaced rather than things anybody chose to admit.
 *
 * THAT FIRST FIGURE READ "ABOUT FORTY-SIX DOLLARS" UNTIL A GRANT CASE WAS
 * WRITTEN OFF THIS PAGE AND THE NUMBERS WERE RUN AGAIN. `billFor` at one
 * learner is 301.07, which is what CLAUDE.md has said all along. Forty-six is
 * close to what the retrenchment ladder now calls Lights on, 45, which is the
 * bill with nobody paid, no tooling and the tutor switched off. Those are two
 * different questions and the comment had quietly answered the wrong one: a
 * page whose whole argument is that its numbers are checkable cannot carry a
 * stale one in its own header.

          Two of those are worth stopping on. A review row is 300 bytes, so a learner
          costs about 1.3 MB a year and the whole review log of a thousand people for a
          year fits in less space than a phone photograph album. And a spoken clip is
          uncompressed audio, 43 KB for every second of it once trimmed and stored as
          16-bit, which still makes speech the largest thing this app moves by a wide
          margin. Turning the audio off in the

        <P>
          Four things, in the order they would matter.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>The daily cap on the tutor could go up.</strong> Every model call in the
          app is booked against a shared budget of{" "}
          ${(DEFAULT_LIMITS.dailyMicrosGlobal / 1e6).toFixed(0)} a day, which cannot be
          turned off and is what stops the one line that could run away. Raising it is a
          knob with a stop on it rather than an open check, and at ten thousand learners
          it is already the thing holding that line down.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>A school could keep its history.</strong> Everything on the progress
          screens is worked out from the review log on each request rather than stored, so
          the log is never thrown away and the database only grows. That is the right
          design and it is what makes the instance ladder the steepest line on this page.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>The corrections could be worked.</strong> The dictionary is built from
          Ekilex and Wiktionary rather than typed, which keeps invented Estonian out of it
          and does not make every entry right. Learners already report the wrong ones.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>Something could go back to the institutions this is built on.</strong>{" "}
          Ekilex, Wiktionary and TartuNLP ask for nothing and there is no suggestion they
          should start. But this app would not exist without any of the three, and at a
          size worth funding the decent thing is to support the work rather than only to
          use it: a contribution, a corrected entry sent back, or paying for the compute
          somebody else is currently absorbing.

          all three are public institutions that decided this work should be available. The
          scheduler, the course, the exams, the games and the grammar run on a server and a
          database and nothing else. What money buys is the tutor, the polish, and somebody
          to work on it.

          So the honest claim is not that this becomes profitable. It is that at{" "}
          ${floor.toFixed(0)} a month it can be kept alive by one person who has not been
          paid, and that it keeps teaching Estonian the whole way down.

          Six things, and every one of them is a file somebody can open rather than an
          intention somebody has stated.

        {CONTINUITY.map((item) => (
          <P key={item.id}>

          Which is the answer to the question under the question. A funder is not really
          asking whether the lights stay on. They are asking whether the money buys
          something that outlives the project, and for a language this size the thing worth
          buying is a corrected dictionary, a course built out of attested sources, and the
          code to run both, all of it published under a licence that lets somebody else
          pick it up.

          There is no advertising, no analytics script and no third-party tracker on any
          page of this app, which the{" "}
          <Link href="/privacy" className="underline underline-offset-2">privacy page</Link>{" "}
          states and the code keeps true: an analytics package was mounted here once, on
          every visitor of the hosted build, while that same notice said there was none.
          It was removed rather than the notice being edited.

          Nothing about a learner is sold, shared or used to train anything. Whether a
          teacher can see a pupil is answered narrowly and separately, and the answer is
          effort rather than contents. Every one of those promises costs money to keep
          rather than saving it, which is most of why this page exists.
