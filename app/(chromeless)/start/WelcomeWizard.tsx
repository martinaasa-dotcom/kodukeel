 *   - **Goal** is why, how far, by when and how often, on one screen, with the
 *     plan those answers produce underneath them rather than on a screen of its
 *     own. Seeing the hours change as you answer is the argument for asking.
 *     Skippable in one press, because a learner in a hurry should be.
 *   - **Start** picks the daily goal and the first units. Last, because the
 *     plan has to be seen before anybody invests an evening in a deck.
 *
 * The tour that was step seven is `/guide`, in the rail and in the palette,
 * where it can be reopened a fortnight in when the question actually arises.

              THE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THE MACHINE RATHER THAN THE LEARNER, ON THE
              SCREEN THAT IS ALREADY ABOUT NEITHER THE LEVEL NOR THE PLAN.

              It is here rather than on a fifth screen. Four screens is the
              shape of this wizard and a question with a screen to itself is
              exactly the fault the last pass over it fixed: this one is a pair
              of buttons and it belongs beside the other thing we need before
              anybody starts typing Estonian.

              `letters-choice` is the same media query the bar itself is drawn
              under, so a phone is not asked. It gets the default written for
              it, which is what it wants: when that learner next opens the app
              on a computer the row is there, and one press removes it.

              Answered live, and the next screen is the level check, which is
              full of Estonian fields. Whatever is chosen here is what they
              meet there.

              It sits in its own panel because it was the most crowded thing on
              this screen: two cards each holding a title, six letter samples
              and a line of explanation, pressed straight up against the field
              above and the note below with the same 8px everything else on the

              new words, because nine of every ten cards you answer are ones you
              have already met. That is the thing nobody is told, and it is why
              a beginner sets Intense in week one and meets two hundred due
              cards in week six.

              So it says both: what the pace buys, and what it costs, with the
              number for this learner's own deck rather than a general warning.

              {minutesFor(goal)} minutes a day, {daysPerWeek} days a week. That is {goal} cards to
              answer, not {goal} new ones. About nine in ten will be words you have already met,
              coming back right when you are starting to forget them. These {counted(deck.cards, "card")} take
              roughly {counted(weeksToLearn(deck.cards, goal, daysPerWeek), "week")} to work through this way,
              and a faster setting really does bring them in sooner. It also makes every day&rsquo;s
              session longer, for the next year. Pick the one you would still open on a bad
              Wednesday.

          NO WAY OUT OF SETUP, AND ONE WAY PAST ONE QUESTION.

          "Skip setup and go straight to the dictionary" sat under every screen
          of this wizard and was the wrong offer twice over. It landed somebody
          on `/dictionary` with no name, no level, no goal and an empty deck,
          which is the app at its least useful and the state every other screen
          then has to apologise for; and it was the most prominent thing on the
          first screen after the Continue button, so the app's own suggestion to
          a stranger was to not use it. Four questions is ninety seconds and
          every one of them changes what the learner is shown afterwards.

          What stays is skipping the *goal*, which is the one screen whose
          answers only feed the plan. Somebody in a hurry can press past it and
          Settings asks the same four questions whenever they want them.
