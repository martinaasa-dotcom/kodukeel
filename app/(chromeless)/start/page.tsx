    THE PLANNED COURSE, AS THE LAST THING FIRST RUN SAYS.

    A stranger who has just answered four questions does not want a dashboard,
    they want to be told what to do tonight. The ladder is the answer, so the
    wizard's final screen names the part they will be on, how long an evening
    takes and what the first one holds, and the button at the end goes there
    rather than to Today.

    The whole ladder rather than one part, so the shape of it is visible at the

    is a course, and one part with nothing behind it is a trial.

    The starter deck for every level, measured rather than estimated.

    This used to be the whole course shipped to the browser as a checkbox list,
    with `words * 2` printed under it as the card count. Both halves were wrong:
    the list asked a stranger a question they had no way to answer, and the
    count was out by a factor of five at A1, because two cards a word is only
    true of a unit that drills nothing. So the server builds the cards the
    starter deck would actually contain and counts them, for each level, and the
    screen states a number it can stand behind.

    Five small queries in parallel, against roughly two hundred and fifty words
    in total. The old screen read every lemma in the course to decide what to
    offer, so this is cheaper than what it replaces as well as truer.
