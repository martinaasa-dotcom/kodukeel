    THE MAILED LINK IS DRAWN UNLESS THE OPERATOR SAYS OTHERWISE.

    It used to be the other way round, off until `EMAIL_SIGN_IN="on"`, on the
    argument that Supabase's built-in sender is a couple of messages an hour
    for the whole project and a form that mails nobody is worse than no form.
    That argument was right about the sender and wrong about the default: the
    switch lived in a dashboard nobody was reminded of, so the one deployment
    this app has ran for weeks with Google as the only door, and the person
    who noticed was the person the door was for. A Google account may not be
    the price of entry, and a default that quietly makes it one is the fault
    the form exists to fix.

    So the door is open unless a deployment closes it. `EMAIL_SIGN_IN="off"`
    is for a copy whose mail really does not go out, and the README says what
    to set up before the second person asks for a link.

    addresses go to the provider rather than into an inbox. The domains are
    not a secret, they are printed on everybody's business card, but the
