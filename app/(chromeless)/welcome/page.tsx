        Ten sections became eight, and eight became five.

        The page was answering every question a visitor could have, in the order
        somebody thought of them. The first cut took out a four-tile source
        credit and a four-figure stat panel, and left a page that still had to be
        scrolled four times before it stopped introducing itself. Nothing in it
        was wrong; there was simply more of it than anybody deciding whether to
        try an app will read.

        Two sections went, and neither lost its argument. "You didn't fail
        Estonian. Your tools did." was three cards making three complaints, and
        each complaint was answered somewhere further down by the thing that
        answers it: the case demo, the scheduler card, the line about a model
        never supplying a form. So each one now sits next to its answer instead
        of a screen and a half above it. "How a day goes" was three steps that
        the feature grid and the closing sentence already described, in the same
        words, twice.

        What is left is the five beats somebody actually needs: what this is,
        why the cases are the hard part, what you get, what the catch is, and
        where to start. The comparison is one of the questions now rather than a
        section of its own, which is where the person asking it looks.

 * a letter with clear air around it reads as a square that missed rather than
 * as one that was put there. With no card there is no edge, and the two other
 * cards big enough to hang them on are a table of Estonian forms and the
 * closing panel, neither of which is the hero. What carries this language's
 * character on the page now is the explorer, which is full of the real thing.
 * Their four checks in `scripts/test-design.mjs` went too, and the suite's

            THE FOUR VOWELS A UK OR US KEYBOARD CANNOT WRITE, over the four
            sides of the card that is full of them.

            They are the reason `lib/ux/letterBar.ts` exists and the first
            thing anybody meets about this language, and they used to hang off
            the hero's flashcard. That card went when this page was cut to five
            screens, and the rule they are placed under is why they could not
            simply stay where they were: THEY ALL TOUCH THE CARD, one to a
            side. A letter with clear air around it reads as one that missed
            rather than as one that was put there.

            So they moved rather than went, and this is the card they belong
            on: the only object left on the page big enough to carry them, and
            the one whose contents are the letters themselves. The hero above
            is a centred column with no box in it, and the closing panel is a
            send-off rather than an introduction.

            WHAT THEY MAY NOT TOUCH IS A CONTROL. On the old card that was one
            full-width pill in the footer; here it is the two word chips near
            the top left, which is why the letter on the top edge sits well
            left of them and is checked against every button inside the card
            rather than against one named pill.

            THE CARD CHANGES SHAPE, which the flashcard did not: the explorer
            stacks into one column below `md`, so it is 707px tall at 640 and
            about 440 above it. The two side letters are therefore placed from
            the top and the bottom rather than at a fraction of a height that
            is not stable, and the gutter they hang in goes 20px, 32px, 96px
            across the three widths, so the hang grows with it.

            EVERY OFFSET IS DERIVED FROM THE CARD'S OWN PADDING rather than
            from where the content happens to sit. The nearest run of text is
            21px from the left edge, 17px from the top, 33px from the right and
            22px from the bottom, measured at all three widths and for both
            words the explorer can show. So a letter that reaches in by less
            than its side's margin, wander included, cannot touch a glyph
            whatever the reader presses: that is a property of the placement
            rather than a lucky gap, which matters because pressing a chip
            changes how many rows the card has.

            THE TRAVEL IS ALONG THE EDGE, WHICH IS WHERE THE ROOM IS. These
            used to wander three or four pixels towards the card, because that
            is the only direction anybody had thought to spend, and against a
            17px margin there is nothing to spend: the movement was real and
            invisible. A letter on the top edge can slide the better part of
            the card's width without coming a pixel nearer anything it could
            land on, so õ and ö now travel 38 and 44px sideways, ä and ü 44
            and 40 up and down their own sides, and what crosses the edge is
            one to three pixels. They were 26 to 30 for a while, over periods
            of up to seven seconds, and were reported as not moving at all:
            measured moving, and too slow and too short a way to be seen by
            anybody not already staring at one. The characters got quicker
            with it (`lib/ux/letterMotion.ts`), and the four hop once, in
            turn, whenever the word under them changes. The rock and the squash are what the small budget
            buys, and `room` is what scales them per letter: a rotated square
            is wider than its side, so 8deg on the tightest of the four is
            worth more than 15deg on the one with a gutter under it.

            The hang is bounded by the other end: the gutter is 20px at 640,
            and a rotated square is wider than its side, so 14deg on 40px puts
            its corners about 4px past the box. That is the difference between
            hanging inside the page's padding and being clipped against it, and
            it is why every letter is smaller below `md` than above it.

            EACH ONE MOVES DIFFERENTLY, and that is the point of there being
            four characters in `lib/ux/letterMotion.ts` rather than one
            keyframe with four delays on it. Four squares doing the same thing
            a second and a half apart is a mechanism. õ ambles, ä crouches and
            springs, ü rolls, ö hangs and swings.

            AND THEY NOTICE A POINTER. Coming near one slides it along its own
            edge towards the cursor and settles it further onto the card, which
            is the same rule as the wander for the same reason. They are still
            `pointer-events-none` and `aria-hidden`: an ornament that
            eats a tap on the card underneath it is a decoration doing
            something no decoration should, and the card underneath is the one
            interactive thing on this page.

  /*
    THREE CARDS, AND WHAT EACH ONE IS FOR CHANGED.

    They were a dictionary, a course and a tutor, which is a list of the parts
    this app is built out of rather than an answer to the question the section
    above just asked. That section ends on somebody who freezes at the counter,
    and the honest next line is how they stop doing that. So the cards are the
    three ways this app is used rather than the three things it contains: the
    person you can ask without anybody watching, the practice that puts the
    words in, and the plan that keeps you turning up. The dictionary did not go
    anywhere; it is the first sentence of the practice card, because looking a
    word up here is how a card gets made.

    ANU LEADS NOW. She was third of three, behind two cards describing
    machinery, and she is the part of this nobody else in the list offers: a
    teacher you can ask a question you are embarrassed by, at eleven at night,
    who answers the question rather than marking it. Her card is also the one
    with something to press, which is worth having early rather than last.

    The history the three replaced, kept because it is the argument for there
    being three of anything at all:

    Eight cards became five, five became four, four became three.

    Three of the original eight said what the hero, the FAQ or another card was
    already saying: a portability card beside an offline tick, a progress card
    beside an XP card, and a "four ways to practice" card that had been wrong
    since the third practice mode shipped. Then the speech card, which is not a
    thing of its own: it is what the dictionary entry does when you press a
    form, so it is a clause on the dictionary card.

    The last to go is the seam between the course and the scheduler, and they
    were never two things. A unit is a sitting's worth of words, adding one
    makes cards, and the scheduler is what brings those cards back: that is one
    loop described twice, once as "here is a syllabus" and once as "here is a
    scheduler", with the sentence joining them left for the reader to write.

    What the bodies carry now is the section that used to sit under this one.
    "How a day goes" was three steps, and all three were already here in other
    words: picking a unit and looking a word up is the first card, adding it in
    a press is the second, and being told you are done for the day is the second
    card's whole point. A step somebody reads twice is a step they read neither
    time.

    Three is also what makes the grid a row again, with no hole to explain.
    `md:col-span-2` on Anu's card had done nothing since the day it was written,
    because the grid item is the `Reveal` wrapper and the span was on the card
    inside it: the layout everybody had been looking at was three cards, then
    two, then a gap where the sixth would go.

          every day. A heading that has to be decoded is a heading that gets

 * The comparison, and the rules it is written under.

 * of an app that has never offered Estonian at all. Comparing yourself with a
 * product nobody can buy in this language is not an honest comparison, and it
 * left the page silent about the tools somebody choosing today is actually
 * choosing between. The fact is now stated plainly and the mascot is gone with
 * it: borrowing somebody else's branding to sell your own thing is the part of
 * a comparison that gets a letter, and the plain sentence was better copy
 * anyway.
 *
 * So the columns are the real ones, and every claim in the table is written to
 * survive being read by the people it is about: a fact taken from that
 * product's own public pages, checked on a stated date, with a third state for
 * the cells we could not confirm rather than a guess in our own favor. No
 * logos, no borrowed branding, nothing about price beyond what their own store
 * listing says, and a credit line under the table for what each of them does
 * better than Kodukeel does. On most of these rows somebody else ticks too,
 * which is what a comparison looks like when it is not rigged.
 *
 * How many is counted from the rows rather than written under them. It said
 * three, the table had grown since, and the true figure was seven: a sentence
 * claiming to be an honest comparison was the one sentence on the page nobody
 * had rechecked. `SHARED_ROWS` cannot drift from the grid it describes.
 *
 * If you add a row, it has to be checkable by a stranger in an afternoon. A row

  TWO SENTENCES EACH, WHICH IS THE WHOLE EDIT.

  Every one of these was true and three of them ran past ninety words. A
  question somebody opened because they wanted a yes or a no was answered with
  a paragraph, and the thing they asked about was in the middle of it: the
  payment answer listed four daily limits with their numbers before saying the
  word that matters, which is no. A reader skims that and leaves knowing less
  than the heading told them.

  So each answer leads with the answer and stops. What went is the detail a
  reader only wants once they are inside, which is a screen they reach by
  signing in rather than a paragraph they scroll past to reach the button.

          TWO ICONS SWAPPED, RATHER THAN ONE CHARACTER TURNED.

          It was the character "+", rotated 45 degrees when the question opens.
          A typed plus is a glyph on a baseline, and a baseline is not the
          middle of the line box: `items-center` centres the line box and the
          font then draws the bar wherever its own metrics say, which in Plus
          Jakarta is above centre. So every one of these circles was off centre,
          and the rotation spun the mark about a point that was not its own
          middle, which is why the cross wobbled as it turned. A lucide icon is
          drawn inside a square viewBox, so its centre is the centre of the box
          it is given, and it measures dead centre on both axes.

          THE ROTATION HAD TO GO WITH IT, and that is `test-containment`
          reading the icon correctly rather than a limitation to work around.
          It asks whether an icon is drawn at the size it declared, and
          `getBoundingClientRect` reports the box *after* an ancestor's
          transform: a 15px square turned 45 degrees is 21px across the axes,
          so the check called it deformed, at all three widths, and it was
          right that something was up. The character it replaced declared no
          width or height, so the check had skipped it and never had an opinion
          about the rotation before.

          A cross-fade of the two stacked on top of each other is the other
          way to keep the motion, and it trades this fault for the collision
          check instead. So the icon swaps: `hidden` is `display: none`, which
          is the one state that leaves nothing behind to measure or to sit
          under. What the animation was carrying was never the meaning anyway;
          the meaning is the mark, and the mark is now the right one and in the
          middle of its circle.

 *
 * `stored` is decided by comparing the printed form with the stem plus the
 * ending rather than by reading `origin`, because an entry enriched from
 * Ekilex carries a lexicographer's form for every case and every one of them
 * would read as stored, which is true and is not what the chip means. The
