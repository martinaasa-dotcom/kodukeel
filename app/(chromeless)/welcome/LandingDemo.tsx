 *
 * THE CARD IS THE SAME SHAPE FOR EVERY WORD, and that is a decision this card
 * used to make the other way. It promoted a stored short illative into the
 * left column, so pressing `tuba` read four and ten where `raamat` read three
 * and eleven: the left column grew a row, the right one lost one and closed
 * up, and the whole card changed height under the reader's pointer. That was
 * honest about the language and wrong about the card, because a table that
 * reshapes itself on every press reads as a table that cannot decide what it
 * is, and the four letters hanging off its edges are placed against a height.
 *
 * So the left column is always the three principal parts, and the right one
 * is always the eleven other cases in the order every schoolbook lists them,
 * with the sisseütlev first and on a row of its own across both columns. It is
 * the one case Estonian has two answers for, and the one that sometimes has to
 * be learned rather than worked out, so its row is where that is said: `tuppa`
 * beside `toasse`, and a chip saying this one is learned. Every other word puts
 * `raamatusse` there with its ending lit, and the row is the same height
 * either way. Six rows on the right, three on the left, at every word.
 *
 * `counted` still counts rather than types the two headings, because a
 * dictionary entry can be missing a partitive and the heading has to be true
 * of the rows under it.

          Two lists of very different lengths in two columns leaves the shorter
          one ending a third of the way down, and the card then reads as having
          lost something out of its bottom left corner rather than as holding

          hold in your head, and they are bigger on the page for the same
          reason they are shorter in number. And because the right column is
          six rows for every word, the three on the left are the same height
          for every word too.

          THE VALUES SETTLE IN PLACE. Pressing a chip used to fade the whole
          list up from fourteen pixels below, which on a card whose rows are
          the same for every word is the rows appearing to drop and land. Now
          each row keeps its box and only the word inside it changes, arriving
