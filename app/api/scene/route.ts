/**
 * One line of one turn, walked up the ladder.
 *
 * `sceneLine` decides which rung answers and `lib/scenes/gate.ts` decides
 * whether a composed line is shown at all. This route is the part of that which
 * needs a socket; everything else it hands over is data the pure modules asked
 * for.
 *
 * WHAT THE MODEL IS ASKED FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT (§6). One line, for one move,
 * inside a closed word list. It never sees the plot, never decides what happens
 * next, never marks anything, and never sees the learner's deck beyond the words
 * lent to the list. Its only output is one line, which is then checked for
 * shape, vouched word by word against that list, checked for register and
 * checked for government. A line that tries to be anything other than a short
 * Estonian sentence fails the shape check; a line reaching outside the list
 * fails vouching; and either way what the learner gets is the fallback, which
 * is somebody asking them to repeat. The worst available outcome is a wasted
 * call and a withheld line.
 *
 * THE LEARNER'S TEXT REACHES A MODEL, SO IT IS DATA (§17). The last two turns
 * go in as conversation, the way the tutor's do, and are never concatenated
 * into an instruction.
 *
 * ONE BOOKING PER COMPOSED TURN (§16), and the first version of this booked one
 * for the whole run instead. The argument for that was real, that running out
 * of allowance halfway through a conversation is the worst failure available
 * here, and it does not survive the arithmetic: the ledger books a call when it
 * authorizes one because two of the three limits count `CALL` rows, so a dozen
 * turns behind one booking is eleven calls the allowance never saw, on the
 * dearest path in the app. What is left of the argument is that the allowance
 * running out mid-scene has to be *survivable*, and it is, because the rung
 * below the model is a real conversational move rather than an error: the
 * other side did not catch that, say it again.
 *
 * The ledger is asked only once the attested rung has failed, because a line
 * the dictionary already had costs nothing and booking for it would ration a
 * learner over a request nobody made. And a booking is handed back where
 * nothing was composed.
