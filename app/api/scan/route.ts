 * model wrote reaches a flashcard: a word the dictionary recognizes brings its
 * own principal parts and retrieved forms with it, and a word it does not is handed
 * back marked as exactly that, for the person holding the paper to confirm or

 * off a page is transcription rather than authorship, but a misread and an
 * invention are indistinguishable from here, so both are treated as a guess.
