/**
 * Restoring a backup, as a Route Handler rather than a Server Action.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md draws the line at "Server actions for mutations; Route Handlers
 * for streaming and third-party proxying", and a file upload sits on the
 * second side of it. This one earned its place by failing: a 990 KB export,
 * two months of one learner's history, was rejected twice over on the way
 * through the Server Action encoding. First by the 1 MB body limit, and then,
 * with that raised, by React's own guard on the decoded payload. Both are
 * properties of the transport, not of the data, and both scale the wrong way:
 * the person with the longest history is the first to lose the ability to
 * restore it.
 *
 * The body here is the backup file itself, sent as text, so nothing re-encodes
 * it on the way in. The mode rides in the query string. Everything that
 * matters, the session check, the schema check, the transaction and the rule
 * that a restore never deletes a review, stays in `restoreBackup`: this only
 * changes how the bytes arrive.
 */
/**
 * The biggest body this route will read, which is the proxy's and no larger.
 *
 * It said 128 MB, on the argument that refusing a genuine backup is worse than
 * accepting a large one. That argument is right and the number could never be
 * reached: every request here passes through the middleware, and
 * `proxyClientMaxBodySize` in `next.config.ts` truncates a body there at 16 MB
 * rather than refusing it. So a 20 MB backup arrived cut short, passed the
 * length check below because it was now exactly 16 MB, failed to parse, and the
 * learner was told their own file did not look like a backup, which is the
 * failure the comment on that setting records the first time round.
 *
 * The same figure here turns that into the honest refusal: the declared length
 * is the caller's claim about the whole file and survives the truncation, so
 * an oversized backup is told it is too large instead of being called
 * something it is not. Raising one means raising the other, and an invariant
 * reads both.

    upload that is a wrong answer, and a discouraging one — the file is a

    A backup is one JSON object, so it ends in a closing brace. Anything that
