 * Restoring a backup, as a Route Handler rather than a Server Action.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md draws the line at "Server actions for mutations; Route Handlers
 * for streaming and third-party proxying", and a file upload sits on the
 * second side of it. This one earned its place by failing: a 990 KB export,
 * two months of one learner's history, was rejected twice over on the way
 * through the Server Action encoding. First by the 1 MB body limit, and then,
 * with that raised, by React's own guard on the decoded payload. Both are
 * properties of the transport, not of the data, and both scale the wrong way:
 * the person with the longest history is the first to lose the ability to
 * restore it.
 *
 * The body here is the backup file itself, sent as text, so nothing re-encodes
 * it on the way in. The mode rides in the query string. Everything that
 * matters, the session check, the schema check, the transaction and the rule
 * that a restore never deletes a review, stays in `restoreBackup`: this only
 * changes how the bytes arrive.

/**
 * The biggest body this route will read.
 *
 * A backup carries the shared dictionary as well as the deck, so a real one is
 * already tens of megabytes and grows as the dictionary does. This is set well
 * above that rather than close to it: refusing somebody's genuine backup is a
 * far worse failure than accepting one that is larger than expected, and the
 * whole point of the route is that the person with the longest history is not
 * the first to lose the ability to restore it.
 *
 * What it is for is the other end. `request.text()` read whatever arrived,
 * with no ceiling anywhere in the app, and `inspect` then handed the result to
 * `JSON.parse`. That is one signed-in account away from holding an arbitrary
 * amount of a server's memory, per request, as often as it likes.
