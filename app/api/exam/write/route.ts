 *
 * Which is also why the failure modes are all quiet. No provider, no quota, no

      a form the model reached for on its own. The note is withheld whole in that
      case, because a correction spelled out of a model's own knowledge is the
      single failure this codebase is organized to prevent.

      That empty allowlist is also why this is the route where the check is most
      likely to withhold over an English word: with no glosses and no forms to
      compare against, any word of five letters or more that the learner did not
      write is caught, and Anu quoting "weather" back at somebody is caught with
      it. Withholding is still the right error. Claiming she wrote Estonian is
      not, so `withheldReason` carries which of the two happened and the result
      screen says the one that is true.
