/**
 * Whether people come back, computed from the review log.
 *
 * There is no analytics vendor here and no tracking to add one. `Review` is
 * append-only and every row already carries an owner and a timestamp, so
 * retention is a derivation over data the app keeps anyway, in the same way XP
 * and streaks are (ADR-014). Nothing new is collected about anybody to produce
 * these numbers.
 *
 * Everything that leaves this route is an aggregate. No owner id, no email, no
 * word anyone searched, no answer anyone gave, and cohorts below MIN_COHORT
 * report their size but not their rates, because "one of two people came back"
 * is a fact about a person rather than a statistic.
 *
 * The impact block is the same rows read for a different reader. Retention,
 * study time and the conversations people report having outside the app are
 * what a grant application asks for, and `lib/research/impact.ts` puts them
 * under the disclosure floors the research export already uses, so a figure
 * small enough to be about a person is absent rather than small. That block
 * honors the research opt-out and the rest of this route does not, which is the
 * difference between a figure an operator reads about their own deployment and
 * a figure that leaves the building. `docs/23-impact.md` is how to quote it.
 *
 * A route rather than a page, so none of it can be pulled into a client bundle,
 * and behind a token so it is not a public description of how the product is
 * doing. With no token configured it does not exist: a 404 rather than a 401,
 * because an unconfigured deployment should not advertise the endpoint.
