/**
 * Marks one sentence a learner wrote about a scene.
 *
 * `/api/write` with a picture in front of it, and deliberately the same order,
 * which is the whole design of both: the dictionary decides what it can decide
 * before any model is asked, so a learner who used the right case is told so
 * with the AI off, a model that hallucinates cannot mark a right form wrong,
 * and an answer that is not a sentence never costs a call.
 *
 * THE PAPER IS REBUILT HERE (ADR-022). The browser posts a scene id, a case
 * and what it wrote, never a mark and never the forms it was marked against.
 * `taskById` assembles the task out of the dictionary again, so the marking is
 * over what the server believes rather than over what the client claimed.
 *
 * The learner's level is read off their own log rather than taken from the
 * request, which is the fix `/api/tutor` needed: a level typed into a client
 * is a level anybody can type.
