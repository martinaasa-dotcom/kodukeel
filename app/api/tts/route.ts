  How much of a free academic service one learner may use in a minute.

  TartuNLP is run by the University of Tartu and asks nothing of us, which is
  exactly why it gets a cap rather than nothing: the whole point of the disk
  cache below is to be a polite consumer of it, and a retry loop with a
  slightly different string each time walks straight past a cache.

  A hundred and twenty is far above real use and far below abuse. Reviewing
  with audio on plays roughly one clip a card, and the fastest anybody clears
  a card is a few seconds, so a real session lands nearer twenty; a script
  reaches this inside a second. The charge is per learner rather than per
  address, so a classroom on one school network is twenty-five allowances
  rather than one -- see lib/security/rateLimit.ts.

  ONE REQUEST UPSTREAM PER CLIP, HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE ASK AT ONCE.

  A cache that is only consulted before the call and only written after it has
  a gap exactly as wide as the call itself, and that gap is where the traffic
  is: a class of twenty-five starting the same unit together asks for the same
  word inside the same second, every one of them misses, and the free service
  we are trying to be polite to gets twenty-five identical requests. The same
  thing happens to one learner whose card renders a word and its example
  sentence side by side.

  The mechanism used to be a `Map` and a `finally` written out here. It moved
  to lib/cache/singleFlight.ts when the dictionary turned out to need exactly
  the same thing: a second copy of this is where the `finally` gets dropped and
  a bad minute upstream is remembered as a failure until the next deploy.

 * What shape a stored clip is, as part of its key.

 * The store is content-addressed, shared across every instance and every
 * learner, and prunes nothing, so a clip written under an old key is served

 * to move this or the fix reaches new phrases only.
 *
 * A CONSTANT BECAUSE THE COMMENT AND THE KEY HAD ALREADY COME APART. The pass
 * that trims by frame, caps the pauses and levels by loudness says in its own
 * message that "the route's cache key and the worker's cache version both
 * move", and its whole diff here was one comment line: the worker went to v4
 * and the key stayed at v3. So every phrase spoken before it kept the 390ms of
 * vocoder hiss that pass measured, while the worker bump made every phone
 * throw away its local copy and fetch the stale one again. Two spellings of
 * one version is one spelling too many.
 *
 * v5 is the pass that made the lead a guarantee rather than a ceiling: a clip
 * now carries exactly `LEAD_MS` of silence in front of its first sound instead
 * of up to that much of whatever the recording happened to have, which measured
 * anywhere from 40 ms to 370 ms across thirty words. A clip written under v4
 * keeps the lead it was given, so this moves with the worker's cache version.

    a request of TartuNLP, a free academic service this app promises to be a
    polite consumer of, and writes a WAV into storage that nothing prunes, on
    a key space of any text a client cares to send. `ALLOWANCE.TTS` in the
    ledger has described the gate for this the whole time and nothing called
    it, so the durable daily allowance was dead code. A hit and a joiner are
    still free: neither asks anybody for anything.

    AND A MISS WITH NOBODY TO CHARGE IS REFUSED RATHER THAN WAVED THROUGH.
    `requireUserId` is caught above so a caller the auth service could not
    answer for still gets a bucket and still gets a clip; the middleware lets
    that state through deliberately, because taking somebody's deck away over
    a bad minute at Supabase is worse than the alternative. What may not
    follow from it is spending. Ternaried into `null`, the ledger was skipped
    for exactly the caller nothing could bill, so during an auth outage a
    request reached TartuNLP and wrote into a store nothing prunes with only
    the per-instance limiter in front of it, which that module says of itself
    is not the thing that bounds cost. `lib/usage` has no off switch and fails
    closed, so this fails closed too: what is already stored still plays, and
    a new clip waits for somebody the meter can name.

 * cache should hold this, and none would have anyway. The audio is not secret
 * and this is not protecting it — it is refusing to claim something that does
 * not happen. Turning this route into a `GET` would make the old header mean
 * something, and would put the sentence being spoken into every access log and
