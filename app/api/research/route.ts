/**
 * Where a lot of people learning Estonian go wrong, as a file somebody can be
 * sent.
 *
 * The whole of what makes this publishable is in `lib/research/corpus.ts`, and
 * the whole of what makes it about Estonian is in `lib/research/sections.ts`.
 * What is here is the database work: nine aggregations, the context a reader
 * needs to weigh them, and two ways of writing the answer out.
 *
 * A route rather than a page, exactly as `/api/metrics` is, and for the same
 * three reasons. None of it can be pulled into a client bundle. It is behind a
 * token, so a deployment is not publishing its learners' difficulty profile to
 * anybody who guesses a URL. And with no token configured it does not exist at
 * all, a 404 rather than a 401, because an unconfigured deployment should not
 * advertise the endpoint.
 *
 * Its own token rather than `METRICS_TOKEN`. The two endpoints have different
 * readers: the metrics one is the operator's own monitoring, polled on a
 * schedule, and this one is pulled by hand perhaps twice a year to send to
 * somebody. Sharing a secret between them would mean anything holding the
 * monitoring credential could also pull the whole corpus.
 *
 * GROUPED IN POSTGRES, NEVER IN NODE. `Review` is the largest table here and
 * the app's own rule is that anything deployment-wide counts in the database.
 * Each query returns one row per (cell, person) rather than per review, which
 * is proportional to the number of distinct combinations rather than to the
 * size of the log, and is also the finest thing the dominance rule can be
 * answered from. No individual review is ever materialized in this process.

  The card the answer was given on.

  `Review` deliberately has no foreign key to `Card`, so that deleting a card or
  restoring a backup cannot cascade the history away, and the consequence is
  that a review can outlive the card it was about. This join is therefore
  allowed to fail, and what to do about the ones that fail took a measurement to
  settle.

  Grouping them as an `unknown` card shape was tried first, on the argument this
  project makes everywhere else, that a source which will not answer is written
  down as a miss rather than dropped. It is the wrong argument here twice over.
  A deleted card is not a shape of question, so a row reading "learners answer
  78% of unknown correctly" is not a finding about Estonian, and the honest home
  for it is the coverage figure the corpus block already carries. And the bucket
  is small by nature, so it fails the threshold rule in nearly every group it
  appears in, which fires complementary suppression on that group and takes the
  real category down with it: measured on a fixture of 55,000 answers, the
  case-by-shape table came back with two rows out of sixteen, none of them for
  a reason a reader could have guessed.

  So it is an inner join, the two tables that use it say so, and how much of the
  corpus it leaves out is reported as `cardsResolvedPct` rather than as a row.

 *

 * grouped by the unit an errand drew its words from, on the argument that a
 * table of conversations ought to say what they were about. Today asks
 * whether any Estonian was spoken yesterday and files the answer under no
 * errand, since a conversation with a neighbor is not this app's to put a

 * of conversations reported and the share in which the other person switched
 * to English, at the start of a term against the end, and the month is the
 * dimension that reads. A day answered "not yesterday" is not a conversation
 * and is not a row (`isConversation`).
 *
 * "CORRECT" IS DEFINED BY THE FIGURE THE FILE CLAIMS TO CARRY, WHICH IS NOT
 * THE SAME AS ONE OUTCOME. It was `= 'UNDERSTOOD'`, and the published note
 * told a reader that one minus the rate is the share in which the other
 * person switched to English. That was true while the only other conversation
 * outcome was `SWITCHED` and stopped being true the day `STUCK` was added, in
 * the direction that overstates the problem: a learner who spoke and ran out
 * of words would have been counted into a switch figure nobody switched out
 * of. It is `<> 'SWITCHED'`, so the note's own sentence is what the query
 * measures and a further answer that is not a switch cannot quietly join it.
 *
 * The month is read in UTC rather than in each learner's zone, because a
 * deployment-wide bucket has no one zone to read, and a report made in the
 * first hours of the first of the month landing in the month before is a
 * fact about the bucket's edge rather than about anybody.
