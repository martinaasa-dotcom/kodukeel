/**
 * A daily reminder, as a calendar file.
 *
 * The obvious implementation is a web push notification, and it is the wrong
 * one here: push needs a server that stays awake, VAPID keys, a subscription
 * store, and it still does not work on iOS unless the app has been installed
 * to the home screen. A calendar event needs none of that, fires on the device
 * the learner already trusts to wake them up, and survives this app being
 * offline, redeployed or closed.
 *
 * One recurring event, no attendees, no alarm chain, the thing a person would
 * have made by hand.
 *
 * THE UID IS A DIGEST, NOT THE ACCOUNT ID. A calendar file is the one thing
 * this app hands a learner specifically so they can give it to somebody else:
 * it goes into Google Calendar or iCloud and syncs to every device on the
 * account. The UID has to be stable, so that re-downloading it updates the
 * event rather than making a second one, and it does not have to be the
 * account id to be stable. A digest is both.
 *
 * The file itself is built in `lib/time/reminder.ts`, which is where the
 * argument about timezones is written down. Short version: the hour a learner
 * picks is a reading on *their* clock, this route runs on a server that is
 * almost always in UTC, and putting the two together used to remind an
 * Estonian learner two or three hours after they asked.
