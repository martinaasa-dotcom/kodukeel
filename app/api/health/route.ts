/**
 * Is this deployment up, and does its database answer.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated, because the readers are an uptime monitor, a
 * load balancer and somebody on the buying side who was pointed here from
 * `/trust` and wants to see the app say something about itself. A health check
 * behind a token is a health check nobody can use, and there is nothing here
 * worth a token: the answer is two words and a commit hash.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT SAY, WHICH IS MOST OF WHAT A HEALTH ENDPOINT USUALLY SAYS.
 *
 * No connection string, no host, no database name, no error message from the
 * driver, no library version, no environment variable value, and no count of
 * anything. Prisma quotes the datasource in an initialization failure, which
 * is the same fault `safeMessage` exists for one layer over: a page or a
 * response built out of what the database said can carry the deployment's own
 * password. So the failure branch here throws the error away entirely and
 * answers with one word, and the real message goes to the server log where it
 * belongs. A version number is withheld for a duller reason: it tells an
 * attacker which advisories to try and tells an honest reader nothing.
 *
 * The build identifier is the exception and is safe because the repository is
 * public. It is the short commit hash, so a report of a fault can be tied to
 * the code that was running, and it is absent rather than invented where the
 * platform did not set one.
 *
 * NEVER AN UNHANDLED THROW. The one thing a health endpoint must not do is
 * fail in a way that looks like the app being wholly down when the app is
 * serving pages perfectly well, so every path here returns a response and the
 * database is asked behind a short deadline rather than the driver's own.

  THE ONE ANONYMOUS ROUTE THAT TOUCHES THE DATABASE, SO ITS COST IS BOUNDED.

  Every other route that reaches Postgres is behind a session or a limiter,
  and this one is deliberately behind neither: a monitor has no session and
  must never be refused. So it was a query per request for anybody, and a
  flood of it was a flood of pooler connections taken from the learners. The
  answer is remembered for a few seconds and concurrent checks share one
  query, so however hard it is called an instance asks the database at most
  once per window. A monitor polling once a minute sees no difference, and an
  outage is reported at most `FRESH_MS` late.
