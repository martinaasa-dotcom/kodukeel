/**
 * Full export. Months of review history is the one thing in this app that cannot
 * be reconstructed from anywhere, so getting it out must never be more than a click.
 * Everything here is this user's own, and it is all of it. That completeness is
 * the point twice over: it is what makes the file a real backup, and it is what
 * Article 20 asks of a copy of your data.
 *
 * THE DICTIONARY THAT TRAVELS IS THE PART THE LEARNER'S ROWS POINT AT.
 *
 * It used to be `prisma.lexeme.findMany({ include: { forms: true } })`, the
 * whole shared dictionary, under a comment saying a restore then works
 * standalone. Two things were wrong with that. It is the one table in the file
 * that grows without the learner doing anything, so a personal backup got
 * bigger every time somebody else's word was added: 15.9 MB in August and 16.5
 * MB after one correction pass, which crossed `bodySizeLimit` and
 * `middlewareClientMaxBodySize` in `next.config.ts` and left the restore
 * refusing a learner's own file. Both limits are 16 MB and both were within a
 * few hundred kilobytes of a file nobody had looked at.
 *
 * And "standalone" was not the property it sounded like. The dictionary is a
 * build artifact of this repository: `npm run db:seed` loads it, every
 * installation has it, and `restoreBackup` merges with `ON CONFLICT DO
 * NOTHING`, so on any real deployment those 6,050 words were bytes that
 * traveled and then did nothing. What a backup is for is the half that cannot
 * be rebuilt, which is exactly the argument `Review` is append-only for.
 *
 * So the file carries the lexemes this learner's own rows reference, with their
 * forms: every word their cards, their review log, their starred list and their
 * reports are about. Measured on a demo deck, 15.19 MB became 0.08 MB, and the
 * size now scales with the deck rather than with the dictionary, which is the
 * property that stops this coming back.

    This used to be five reads, and /privacy described the result as "every
    card, review, task, scanned page and setting" and then said "Nothing is
    held back from it." Settings were not in it. Neither were the
    conversations with Anu, the level checks, the starred words or the badges.
    Two of those are the kind of gap that matters rather than the kind that
    tidies up: a level check is a measurement that no log can reconstruct, and
    a tutor conversation is the learner's own writing.

    Article 20 is a right to receive the personal data concerning you, and a
    file that quietly stops at five tables out of ten is not that. The four
    added here complete it. `UsageEvent` is deliberately not among them and
    the reason is on /privacy: it is this deployment's spending record, kept
    to enforce a cap, and its contents are a count and a cost rather than
    anything the learner produced. It is deleted with the account like
    everything else.

    THEN IT STOPPED AT TEN OUT OF THIRTEEN, AND THE CHECK SAID IT DID NOT.

    The invariant behind the paragraph above reads the owner-scoped models out
    of the schema so that a new table fails until somebody decides about it.
    Three had been added to its skip list instead of to this query: mock exam
    sittings, classes and class memberships. A skip list with one reasoned
    entry is a decision; a skip list anybody can append to is the parking space
    this project's own copy rules warn about, and it had become one. The
    exclusions carry their reason now (`lib/legal/exportCoverage.ts`) and the
    check fails on an unexplained one, so this cannot happen a third time
    quietly.

    A mock sitting is the sharpest of the three: it holds the composition the
    learner wrote, which no log reconstructs and no other table keeps.

  /*
    Which words to carry, asked before the rest so the answer can be used.

    Four tables reference a lexeme and every one of them is the learner's own.
    `Review` keeps `lexemeId` as a plain column with no relation, deliberately,
    so it outlives the card it was about: a word they have not had a card for
    in a year is still a word their history is about, and leaving it out would
    restore a log pointing at nothing.
