        Kodukeel is a study tool. These terms are short because the arrangement is
        simple: use it to learn Estonian, do not abuse the shared services behind it,
        and understand what it can and cannot promise you.

      <S title="What it promises">
        <P>
          Every Estonian word form here comes from Ekilex, the dictionary database run by the
          Institute of the Estonian Language. None of it is generated. Where a form is shown
          as derived from a stored genitive stem, it is labeled as derived.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>Anu is a machine, and says so on every screen she speaks from.</strong> You
          are talking to a language model, not to a teacher, and the app is required to make
          that unmistakable rather than merely true. Which model answered is printed under
          each reply, because a screen naming the wrong one would be worse than naming none.
        </P>
        <P>
          She is not the final word on anything. She can explain grammar and suggest an
          English translation, but her explanations can still be wrong. Do
          not rely on her for an exam answer without checking it yourself.
        </P>
        <P>
          The app is provided as it is, with no warranty. It is a learning aid, not a
          certified language qualification.

      <S title="What is asked of you">
        <P>
          Use one account, and use it yourself. Do not use the tutor to generate content
          unrelated to learning Estonian. It runs on a key that costs money per use, so
          there is a daily limit on every account, to stop one person using it all up for
          everyone else.
        </P>
        <P>
          Do not write scripts to hammer the dictionary, the speech service or the tutor
          with requests. Ekilex and TartuNLP are free academic services, and this whole
          project depends on nobody abusing them.
        </P>
        <P>
          Be 13 or older, or have a parent agree first. Estonia sets the age at which
          somebody can agree to a service like this for themselves at 13, which is the
          youngest any country in the Union sets it. Nothing here checks, and saying so is
          more use than a box that anybody can tick: if you are a teacher signing a class
          up, that agreement is the one thing worth getting before you send the link.

          The dictionary is two sources joined, and they carry different licenses, so it is
          worth being exact rather than tidy. Every Estonian form and every example sentence
          comes from Ekilex and is licensed <strong>CC BY 4.0</strong> by the Institute of
          the Estonian Language. Every English gloss that was not written for this project
          comes from <a

            target="_blank"

          >English Wiktionary</a> and is licensed <strong>CC BY-SA 4.0</strong> by its
          contributors, which is the stricter of the two: a work built on it has to be
          shared on the same terms. Both are credited on the sign-in page and in the
          footer, and the split between them is the whole design of the dictionary rather
          than an accident of it.

          The order the commonest words are listed in comes from <a

            rel="noreferrer"

          >FrequencyWords</a>, a published count over the OpenSubtitles corpus, also
          licensed <strong>CC BY-SA 4.0</strong>. It decides nothing but an order: every
          word shown is the dictionary&rsquo;s own.

          Whether a spelling is an Estonian word at all, and which word it is a form of,
          is answered by a forms list built from Ekilex&rsquo;s own inflection tables, as
          published in <a
            href="https://github.com/KristjanPikhof/Estonian-Wordlist-Enriched-Ekilex"

          >Vabamorf</a>, Filosoft&rsquo;s open-source morphological tools for Estonian

          what a card teaches: no form from it is ever drilled or marked against.

      <S title="Ending it">
        <P>
          You can stop and delete your data at any time. An installation may withdraw
          access to an account that is abusing the shared services described above.

      <S title="Which law applies">
        <P>
          Estonian law governs these terms and anything arising from them, and the Estonian
          courts are where a dispute ends up. Nothing here takes away a right you have as a
          consumer where you live: if the law of your own country gives you something these
          terms do not, that law wins.
