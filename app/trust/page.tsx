          <strong>What this project does not have, stated plainly.</strong> There is no SOC 2
          report. There is no ISO/IEC 27001 certificate. The control map is a self-assessment
          written by the people who wrote the code, and it has not been reviewed by anybody
          outside this project. No external penetration test has been commissioned, so
          nobody has attacked this application under contract, and no independent reviewer has
          read the source for security faults. The code being public is not the same thing as
          having been audited.
        </P>
        <P>
          Four more limits worth naming before you find them yourself. Ownership of rows is
          enforced in application code and asserted in the build rather than by Postgres row
          level security. The Content Security Policy carries{" "}
          <code>&lsquo;unsafe-inline&rsquo;</code> in its script sources, for a reason written
          out in the code, and that is the weakest line in it. Nothing watches the logs
          continuously: there is no intrusion detection and no alerting beyond an optional
          error webhook. And multi-factor authentication is inherited from whatever the
          learner&rsquo;s Google account has rather than enforced here.
        </P>
        <P>
          What is there instead is a build that fails on the rules rather than a document
          asserting them: the credential scan greps the built client bundle for every
          server-only value, the invariant suite asserts the rules this project set itself,
          and the browser suites drive the real app. All of it runs on every change.
        </P>
        <P>
          One of those suites is worth naming, because it is the only one that asks these
          questions of a server rather than of the source. It sends the forged requests, reads
          back every security header, checks that what is behind a token stays behind it, and
          reads what the health endpoint is willing to say. It found something on its first
          run: a request carrying an address the app could not parse was being treated as a
          request carrying none, and those had different answers. That is the shape of thing it
          is for. It is a test written by the people who wrote the code, so it cannot tell you
          the design is right, and it is not the outside look this section says is missing.
        </P>
      </S>

      <S title="Availability">
        <P>
          <strong>There is no contractual service level today.</strong> No uptime percentage
          is promised anywhere in this app or in its terms, and nothing here is worth quoting
          as one. What can be said is what the app does when things break, which is a design
          decision rather than a hope.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>The review path survives losing the network.</strong> A grade answered with
          no connection goes into a queue in the browser and is sent later with the time it
          was actually answered, never dropped and never restamped, so a session on a train
          costs nothing. The service worker keeps the pages a learner was last on and an
          offline screen behind them, so the app opens rather than showing a browser error.
          The dictionary, the tutor and speech all need a connection and say so instead of
          serving something stale.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>When the database is unreachable</strong>, pages that need it fail to an
          error screen that says nothing has been lost, which is true: the review log is only
          ever appended to. The message itself stays on the server, because a database error
          can quote a connection string, and what the screen shows is a reference you can
          quote back at us.
        </P>
        <P>
          <strong>When an AI provider is having a bad minute</strong>, the app moves to the
          next provider configured rather than failing, and where none answers the feature
          says so. Nothing that teaches Estonian depends on a model: the dictionary, the deck,
          the scheduler, the exam and every practice round work with no AI provider at all.

          answers without a session and returns whether the app is up, whether the database
          answers, and the commit this build came from. It carries no counts and nothing about
          anybody. A monitor can poll it.
