    WHERE THE BUILD GOES, WHICH IS ONLY EVER A QUESTION FOR ONE SUITE.

    Whether this app gates every route or runs as one local learner is decided
    by `supabaseConfigured()`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables are inlined when
    the bundle is built rather than read when it starts. So the mode is a
    property of the build: a server started with the keys cleared still gates
    every route if the build had them, which was measured rather than assumed.

    Every browser suite runs against a local-mode build, which is why the
    hosted sign-in screen, the first thing any stranger meets, had never been
    rendered by anything. `scripts/test-signin.mjs` builds its own in hosted
    mode, and it needs somewhere to put it that is not the build the other
    suites are running against.

    Defaults to `.next`, so nothing else in the repository or on a deployment
    sees any of this.

    This was `eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: false }` here, and the argument for

    request, which is where the code actually arrives, until somebody runs
    `vercel --prod` by hand, or forks this and trims the workflow, and then a
    rule this repository treats as non-negotiable is enforced by nothing at all.

    Next 16 removed the built-in ESLint integration, so the key is gone and the
    guarantee has to be carried by something else rather than dropped with it.
    `prebuild` in `package.json` is that something: npm runs it before `build`
    on its own, so `npm run build` and a deploy that calls it both lint first,
    which is the set of callers the config key reached. Deleting the script is
    the same decision as setting `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` was, and an

    THE FORMS LIST TRAVELS WITH THE DEPLOYMENT.

    `lib/dict/forms.ts` reads `prisma/data/forms/` at runtime, and a bundler
    traces what a module imports rather than what it opens, so without this a
    hosted function has the reader and none of the files: every dictionary
    miss says "nothing found" and Sõnad refuses every guess, silently, on the
    one platform the app is measured on. Traced into every function, since the

    THIRTEEN ROUTES PROVABLY NEVER OPEN THE FORMS LIST, AND THE INCLUDE ABOVE
    WAS COSTING EVERY ONE OF THEM 28 MB THEY NEVER READ.

    The include above is a blanket `/**` because the comment beside it once
    believed only two things read `lib/dict/forms.ts`: a page and a Server
    Action. That stopped being true as soon as `app/actions.ts` grew into the
    one shared Server Actions file most of the app imports, and it stopped
    being true a second way that is easy to miss: `app/layout.tsx`, the root
    layout every page in this app renders under, mounts `OfflineProvider`,
    which references `replayGrades` from `app/actions.ts`. A Server Action
    referenced from a client component still has to be resolvable on the
    server that rendered it, so that reference alone was enough to pull the
    forms-reading code into the bundled function for pages that never
    mention a dictionary: `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/trust`, `/sign-in`, and
    every other leaf page in the tree.

    So this was not decided by reading imports. Every route was built once
    and its real `.nft.json` trace (and the compiled chunk each one actually
    loads) was inspected for the one function inside `lib/dict/forms.ts` that
    touches the shard files on disk. Only Route Handlers that render no
    layout at all, and that do not themselves import anything on the
    `lib/dict/facts.ts` / `lib/progress/scene.ts` / `app/actions.ts` side of
    the graph, came back clean: health and metrics, the audio and export and
    scan endpoints, the auth callback, and the icon/manifest generators.
    Nothing here was excluded on the strength of reading its source alone —
    that is exactly the kind of judgement the original two-readers comment
    got wrong, so this list is only ever grown by rebuilding and checking the
    trace again, never by re-reading imports and reasoning about them.

      failed with a 413 that never reached the screen. The learner with the
      most history to lose is the first to hit it, which is the worst possible
      order.

      16 MB is roughly a decade of daily review at the observed rate, and it is
      only a ceiling: nothing is allocated by raising it. RestorePanel now
      surfaces the failure rather than swallowing it, so the day somebody does
      exceed this they are told, and told to say so, instead of watching a
      button do nothing.

      AND THE SAME CEILING AGAIN, THROUGH A DOOR THAT DID NOT EXIST WHEN THE
      COMMENT ABOVE WAS WRITTEN.

      Restoring a backup was moved out of a Server Action and into
      /api/restore precisely to get out from under a body limit. Next 15.5
      then added `middlewareClientMaxBodySize`, which defaults to 10 MB and
      applies to any request that passes through middleware — and this app's
      middleware matches every route, because the forged-request gate has to.

      So the route built to escape a limit acquired a lower one, and it fails
      in the worst available way: the body is *truncated* at 10 MB rather than
      refused, so the JSON arrives cut in half, fails to parse, and the
      learner is told their file "doesn't look like a Kodukeel backup". It
      looks exactly like a Kodukeel backup. It is one.

      Measured: a full dictionary and one learner's deck exports at 15.3 MB,
      which is over the old ceiling and under the new one, so the restore path
      was broken for anybody whose dictionary had grown past a few thousand
      words. `scripts/test-restore.mjs` catches it now; it did not before,
      because it was last run against a database small enough to fit.

      AND THEN IT CROSSED THIS ONE TOO, which is what finally moved the fix to
      the right place. One correction pass over the dictionary took the export
      from 15.9 MB to 16.5 MB and the restore started refusing a learner's own
      file. Raising the ceiling again would have bought a few thousand words,
      because the file was growing with the *dictionary* rather than with the
      person: `/api/export` sent every lexeme in the database. It sends the
      words that learner's own rows point at now, 0.08 MB on a demo deck, and
      the ceiling below stopped being a countdown.

      Matched to `bodySizeLimit` above deliberately. Two limits on the same
      upload that disagree is how this happened, and the next person to raise
      one needs to find the other in the same glance.

      Next 16 renamed the key to `proxyClientMaxBodySize`. The old spelling
      still builds and prints a deprecation on every start, which is the shape
      of warning a reader learns to scroll past, so it is the new one here.

      HOW LONG THE BROWSER MAY REUSE A PAGE IT HAS ALREADY FETCHED.

      Next's default for a dynamic route is **zero**, and every route in this
      app is dynamic, correctly: a deck, a streak and a due count are facts
      about the person reading. Zero means the router cache holds nothing, so
      going back to the page you were on ten seconds ago is a fresh render of
      it, queries and all. Somebody moving between Today, Practice and their
      deck the way this app is meant to be used paid full price for every one
      of those, in both directions, and that is what "the navigation feels
      slow" turned out to mean.

      Thirty seconds is chosen against what a stale panel actually costs here.
      A mutation is not covered by it and does not have to be: every one in
      this app is a Server Action and every one of them calls
      `revalidatePath`, which drops the client's copy of those routes as well
      as the server's. So grading a card, adding a word or ticking a task
      still shows up immediately on Today. What thirty seconds buys is the
      case with no mutation in it at all. Reading the grammar page, going
      back, opening the dictionary, going back: that is most of what moving
      around an app is.

      `static` is what a link marked `prefetch` is held under, which here means
      a page fetched because a pointer settled on it (components/PrefetchLink).
      Two minutes rather than the default five: a page fetched on a hover is
      still a page somebody is about to read, and it should not be able to be
      much older than the moment they reached for it.
