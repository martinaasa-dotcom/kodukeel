/**
 * WHERE ONE WORD DEPARTS FROM THE PATTERN, ON THE ENTRY FOR THAT WORD.
 *
 * The dictionary printed `tuppa` in the illative row of a table headed "the
 * rest, worked out from the genitive" and said nothing about the two facts
 * being in tension. A learner reading that page comes away with the ending
 * `sse` and a form that does not have it, and no way to know which of the two
 * to reach for tomorrow.
 *
 * A WORD CAN BREAK MORE THAN ONE PATTERN AND EACH ONE IS ITS OWN ROW. `aeg` has
 * four: the stem, the partitive, the short illative and the plural. Rolling
 * those into one sentence is what the gradation chip already did, and it is why
 * that chip taught nobody anything: "gradation g : j" is true, sits above a
 * table with four surprises in it, and points at none of them.
 *
 * WHAT IS PRINTED IS ALWAYS A FORM THE DICTIONARY VOUCHES FOR. The pattern's own
 * answer appears only where it is also a real word, which is the illative and
 * nothing else: `toasse` is correct Estonian and is accepted everywhere the
 * short form is shown, and the partitive the ending rule would build for `aeg`
 * is not a word at all. Printing one with a line through it would be this app
 * writing Estonian and hoping nobody memorized it (ADR-005).
 *
 * The slot's Estonian name and the question it answers lead, and the plain
 * clause from `lib/estonian/plainAsk.ts` sits under it, which is the order
 * every card in the app takes since a learner reported that a name they cannot
 * cash in is furniture.

 * learner reported, correctly, that it never said which of the two that was.
 * A form on the screen with nothing saying what it is is the same dead end as
 * a form that is missing.
 *
 * One drawing rather than one per screen, for the reason `StarWord` gives about
 * itself: the round and the dictionary entry disagreeing about which illative
 * is the short one is worse than either answer on its own. It takes the two
 * spellings rather than a `WordException`, because the round holds a task
 * rather than an exception and a second copy of this paragraph is where the two
