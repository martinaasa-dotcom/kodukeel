        reads as broken, and the server's own cleaning pass is built on the

        list the next, and a FIX: box that appeared, moved and reflowed under
        the reader's eyes. A typed reply is typography, and typography set a
        character at a time is never clean while it is being set.

        So the chunks are gathered here and the bubble shows that Anu is
        writing until they have all landed, then the finished reply in one
        go, parsed and drawn as a whole. What it costs is the sight of words
        arriving; what it buys is that the first thing a learner reads is
