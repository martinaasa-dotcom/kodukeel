 * has two states rather than one. Before a reply, all this can say is which

 * actually wrote what is on screen, read off the reply's own headers, which
 * with a fallback chain configured is not always the same thing.
 *
 * `compact` is the floating panel, and it keeps only the half that is a fact
 * about something on screen. Three things were being said in one gray block
 * under the box a learner types into: where Estonian forms come from, which is
 * a standing fact about Anu rather than about any answer; which provider the
 * deployment *would* ask, which is a prediction about a reply that does not
 * exist yet; and which model actually wrote what is on screen. Only the last
 * is a fact about the answer, and it is the only one a 24rem panel has room
 * for. So the standing fact is said once, in the line under her name in the
 * panel's header, and the prediction is not made at all: "Will ask OpenRouter
 * · google/gemma-4-31b-it:free." was the largest thing on the panel a learner
 * had not asked anything yet, and it named a model that had answered nothing.
 *
 * Nothing is softened by dropping it. What makes Anu's Estonian checkable is
 * that each piece of it is boxed and tagged in the reply itself, and the full
 * `/tutor` page, which has the room, still says all three.
