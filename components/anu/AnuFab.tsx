 * Anu, reachable from anywhere: a button in the bottom right corner of every
 * signed-in screen, opening the same conversation the `/tutor` page shows.
 *
 * Mounted once in `app/(app)/layout.tsx`, which the App Router does not remount
 * on client-side navigation, so the open panel and the conversation inside it
 * survive moving between pages exactly the way the rest of the app's global
 * chrome (the command palette, the install prompt) already does. Hidden on
 * `/tutor` itself, which renders the same conversation full-page: without that,
 * a learner there would see two copies of one exchange and two boxes to type
 * into.
 *
 * The panel stays mounted, hidden rather than unmounted, once it has been
 * opened once: closing it must not lose a reply mid-stream or throw away a
 * conversation that is about to be refetched from the database anyway.
