    Whether this panel is still an invitation or is now a conversation.

    Everything that says "here is how to begin" belongs to the first state and
    nothing else does. The panel used to carry all of it at once: a greeting, a
    bordered button offering to check a sentence, six starters over three rows
    and three lines of gray provenance, stacked under whatever was being said,
    so a learner reading an answer about the partitive was reading it through a
    menu they had already used. That is where this started, and withholding the
    lot once a question has been asked was only half of it: on the first screen
    of a panel nobody had asked anything on yet, all of it was still there at
    once. What is left is one row of ways in.

    Withheld rather than deleted, which is the same distinction `lib/ux/`
    draws: this is the compact surface, and `/tutor` is the same conversation
    with room around it and every starter always on screen.

        It had a maximum and no minimum, so it was exactly as tall as
        whatever was in it: a short panel on opening, then a taller one
        after the first question, then taller again, growing under the
        reader a message at a time and finally jumping to a scroller. Every
        one of those is a different window and none of them was the one they
        opened. A floor rather than a fixed height, because a panel that
        cannot grow at all is the same fault at the other end.

        The floor is what a conversation needs before it has to scroll: two
        exchanges of the length Anu actually writes, which is a paragraph of
        grammar and a boxed correction under it. Both ends give way to a
        short window first, so the arithmetic is the same expression twice
        and the floor can never end up above the ceiling.

        this panel; after one it names the model that actually wrote what

        a card the width of the panel that a learner scrolled past to reach
        the answer they asked for, and the provider line was three lines of
        grey under the box they type into. Both are facts about Anu rather

        they cost the thread nothing.
