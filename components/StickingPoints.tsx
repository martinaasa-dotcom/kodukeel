              The row wraps and the actions keep their own width, so with only
              `flex-1` the text side is whatever is left: 110px on a 360px
              phone, which broke `aatomipomm` across two lines and stacked
              "Estonian" over the arrow and "English". Every row was four lines
              tall and the word, which is the thing you are looking for, was the
              hardest part of it to read.

              A basis of 13rem is more than the actions and the text can share
              at that width, so the actions take a line of their own and the
              word gets the first one. It is inside a 280px card at its
              narrowest, so nothing leaves the box, and above `sm` there is room
              for both and the row is one line again.
