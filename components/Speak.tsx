 * browser's speechSynthesis has no dependable et-EE voice — it fails silently, or
 * reads Estonian in an English accent. If the proxy cannot produce audio the button
 * disappears rather than sitting there doing nothing.
 *
 * The voice is the learner's own, read from the shell (components/AudioPrefs.tsx),
 * and `autoplay` reads the clip aloud the moment the button appears, once, if
 * they have that switched on. A browser refuses to play sound on a page nobody
 * has touched yet, and that refusal is not a fault in the service: it leaves the
 * button in place to be pressed, where a clip that could not be fetched at all
 * takes the button away.
