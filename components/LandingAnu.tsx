/**
 * ANU, COMING DOWN THE LANDING PAGE WITH YOU.
 *
 * She is the one thing on this page nobody else offers and she was on it as a
 * paragraph and a sample question, third card of three. Inside the app she
 * sits in the corner of every screen, so this is the same seat on the one
 * screen a stranger sees: her face in the corner, her eyes on the pointer, and
 * a line of her own for whichever section the reader has reached. When the
 * page moves on she hops once, which is her keeping up rather than being
 * carried, and her mood changes with the subject: thinking over the case
 * table and the questions, cheering at the door.
 *
 * WHICH SECTION IS "REACHED" IS THE ONE MOST ON SCREEN, read through an
 * `IntersectionObserver` with a handful of thresholds rather than a scroll
 * listener, so nothing here runs on the scroll path. The hero wins on
 * arrival because it is the first thing observed, and a section takes over
 * only when more of it is visible than of the one before, which is what
 * stops her changing her line twice while two sections share the window.
 *
 * SHE IS A LINK, not a decoration, and the link goes where she lives. A
 * stranger who presses the tutor expects to talk to her, and the honest
 * answer is that she answers inside, so the target is sign-in and the label
 * says so. The bubble beside her is decoration and is marked as such: it is
 * her line for a sighted reader, and a screen reader gets the link's label
 * without a speech bubble read out over it every time the page scrolls.
 *
 * NOT ON A PHONE. Below `sm` the corner she would take is the corner the
 * page's own full-width button ends in, and a phone has no pointer for her
 * to watch; the cards still carry her. No `backdrop-filter`, because she is
 * `fixed` over content that moves, and that pairing is what CLAUDE.md
 * forbids. `bottom-notice` is the same clearance the in-app button reads, so
 * the two sit in the same place on either side of the door.
