/**
 * WHERE EVERY WORD STANDS, WORD BY WORD.
 *
 * The learner asked twice for this, and the second time because the first
 * answer was a panel three cards down a page about the deck: "I dont see it
 * anywhere". A list somebody has to find is a list nobody reads, so it has a
 * page of its own, a row in the rail's own table and a link from every screen
 * that talks about mastery.
 *
 * COUNTED IN WORDS, NOT CARDS, which is what makes it different from the deck
 * box on `/words`. That counts cards and reads the FSRS state, so one word
 * contributes four or five rows and "Known" means "this card's interval is
 * long". A learner does not think in cards. `masteryOf` is the rule and it is
 * about the word.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ROW SAYS. How many correct answers, how many different forms they
 * span, and which forms those were, because "you are 60% of the way there" is
 * a number and "you have had this right in the seesütlev and the osastav" is
 * something to act on. The bar reads the smaller of the two shares, so a word
 * right eight times in one form does not show as nearly finished.
 *
 * Server-rendered: the lists are read once and nothing here is interactive
 * beyond the links, so there is nothing for a client bundle to do.
