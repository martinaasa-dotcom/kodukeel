/**
 * FAVORITE THIS WORD, WHEREVER THE WORD IS.
 *
 * Asked for directly: a star in the corner of every card that puts a word or a
 * phrase in front of somebody to learn, so the one they want to come back to
 * can be kept in the moment they notice it rather than remembered until they
 * next open the dictionary. Starring already existed and lived on exactly one
 * screen, the dictionary entry, which is the screen a learner is least often
 * on: the words they care about are met on a review card.
 *
 * ONE DRAWING, FOR THE REASON `WeakestCases` IS ONE COMPONENT. A star copied
 * into four sessions is four answers to what a favorite looks like and what
 * it does when the toggle fails, and the copy nobody is looking at is the one
 * that stops saying which state it is in.
 *
 * THE ACCENT, WHICH IS THE HUE THAT MEANS "THIS IS YOURS"
 * (`docs/14-design-system.md` §1). The dictionary's own star was butter, which
 * that table gives to "nearly, timed, a warning that isn't a failure", and on
 * a review card butter is what a near miss is painted: a bookmark wearing the
 * grading scale's color on the screen that grades is a hue making a claim it
 * does not mean.
 *
 * AND THE HUE IS NOT THE ONLY THING SAYING WHICH STATE IT IS IN. The star is
 * filled when it is on and outlined when it is not, it carries `aria-pressed`,
 * and its label says what pressing it will do.
 *
 * NOT QUEUED WHEN THE NETWORK IS GONE. A grade is an answer and goes into the
 * outbox because losing one loses evidence (ADR-015); a star is a bookmark,
 * and the honest thing to do with one that did not land is to put the button
 * back the way it was rather than to promise it later.

/*
  WHAT THIS TAB HAS PRESSED, BY WORD.

  The state is reset from the page's own snapshot every time the word changes,
  and a snapshot taken when the page loaded does not know about a press made
  since: a word met twice in one session, its recognition card and then its
  production card, came back drawn as not a favorite a minute after it was
  made one. This is the answer the server gave to each press this tab made,
  read before the snapshot; a reload reads the snapshot fresh.

    THE STATE IS RESET BY THE WORD, NOT BY A KEY AT THE CALL SITE.

    Every screen this sits on shows one word after another out of one queue,
    and React keeps a component's state while its position in the tree holds
    still: without this, starring a word and pressing Next left the next word
    drawn as a favorite it is not. A `key` at each call site fixes it and is
    the thing a fifth caller forgets, which is the argument this repository
    makes about every rule it moved out of a caller. This is React's own
    pattern for a state that a prop supersedes, and it re-renders immediately
    rather than after a paint, so nothing is ever drawn in the stale state.
