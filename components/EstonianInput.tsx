/**
 * Estonian text input with the letter bar under it.
 *
 * The bar is `DiacriticBar` rather than a second copy of one: it used to build
 * its own row from its own list of letters, so the two could disagree about
 * which letters exist, and now do about whether they are drawn at all.
 *
 * `fallbackRef` is this field, which is what preserves the behavior the copy
 * had. The shared bar types into whatever has focus, and a learner who presses
 * õ before clicking anywhere would otherwise be typing into nothing.
 *
 * `inputRef` is for a caller that has to reach the field itself, which so far
 * is Anu: picking one of her starters writes a half-written question into a box
 * somewhere else on the panel, and a learner who is not put in it has to work
 * out for themselves that anything happened. The bar still needs a field to
 * fall back to, so the caller's ref is used as this component's own rather than
 * kept alongside it: two refs on one input is how they come apart.
 *
 * `disabled` is the one moment a conversation takes the box away: a scene that
 * moves the learner from a kitchen to a shop covers the screen while it does
 * (`components/scene/SceneInterlude.tsx`), and a turn typed into a scene that
 * is halfway through moving is a turn answered about the wrong place. The
 * letter bar goes with it rather than sitting under a box nothing can be typed
 * into, since the bar types into whatever has focus and there is nothing to
 * focus.
 *
 * `compact` is the floating Anu panel, the one place this field sits beside a
 * button inside a 26rem card rather than across a page. At the default size a
 * long placeholder such as "Why is it raamatut and not raamatu?" ran past the
 * edge of that narrow box and was clipped mid-word, so `compact` drops to the
 * dense-UI type step and tighter padding, the same step `Button`'s own default
 * size reads from.
