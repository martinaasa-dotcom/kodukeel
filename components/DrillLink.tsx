/**
 * The drill that belongs on the page you are already standing on.
 *
 * Four practice modes are drills for a named weakness, which is what
 * `lib/ux/modes.ts` has always called them, and all four used to sit on a menu
 * under a heading saying exactly that. A menu is the wrong shape for them: it
 * offers five answers to a question the learner has not asked, and it is the
 * one place they have no reason to be looking when the question does occur to
 * them. So each is now on the screen that names the thing it drills, and that
 * screen is the one place it is obviously worth pressing: the leech clinic
 * under the panel listing the cards you keep failing, the verb government drill
 * under the page explaining rektsioon, writing under the case it asks you to
 * write in, and pasting your own Estonian beside the scanner.
 *
 * The title, the blurb, the icon and the hue all come from `modeAt`, so a mode
 * renamed in one table is renamed on every page that offers it. That is the
 * same argument `lib/ux/nav.ts` makes about itself, and it is why this is one
 * component rather than four hand-drawn cards.
