    THE GUARD IS A REF BECAUSE THE HANDLER IS REGISTERED ONCE.

    `sync` was memoised on `[syncing]` and captured by an effect with no
    dependencies, so the copy wired to `online`, `visibilitychange` and the
    thirty-second interval kept the `syncing === false` it was born with. Two
    passes could overlap, read the same rows, and both miss the "already
    replayed" check on the server; `prisma.review.create` is given the id the
    client generated, so the second one raises a unique violation and fails the
    whole batch, which the learner reads as having gone offline. A ref is the
    same guard read at the moment it is asked rather than at the moment the
    handler was made. The state stays for the banner's spinner, which is a
    render and wants the render's value.

    what is left, so a pass already running meant counting a batch still in

          accepts it and `writeGrade` reads it, and this `map` named five
          fields and dropped it. So the one thing the flash round's own

          about the kaasaütlev would go down as an answer about whatever the
          card happens to be") was dropped one function later, on the server
          action's doorstep, for every grade taken offline.

          Spreading rather than listing, because the fault is the listing: a
          column added to the outbox and to the server and not to the six
          field names in the middle is a column that silently never arrives,
          and nothing fails. `replayGrades` takes `ReplayItem`, so a field the
