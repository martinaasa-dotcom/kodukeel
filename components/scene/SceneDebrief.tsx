 * 2. **What you got done**: the required beats, ticked. A count of things
 *    achieved, never a percentage, because a mark on a conversation is a claim
 *    about somebody's Estonian and only the mock exam may make one (ADR-022).
 * 3. **Your turns**, so a learner can read back what they actually said.
 * 4. **How it went**, which is the review a teacher gives after a role-play:
 *    it leads on how much of what you said was understood, and then names
 *    each ending that came out as something else, what that ending is for,
 *    and your own words beside the ones the other side used. English, and
 *    derived from the transcript rather than written here
 *    (`lib/scenes/review.ts`).
 * 5. **The words you needed and did not have**, each with an add-to-deck
 *    button, from the help button and from the beats that stalled.
 * 6. **One thing to work on**, as a `DrillLink` into the drill that addresses
 *    it, rather than advice this screen wrote itself.
 * 7. **The real one.** The errand this scene rehearses, and where the people
 *    are. This is the screen a learner is on the moment they have just proved
 *    they can book the appointment, and it used to end in "have it again":
 *    the purpose of the app is to be left (`docs/22-real-life.md`), and a
 *    rehearsal that ends in another rehearsal keeps somebody inside. Shown
 *    only where every required beat was met, because sending somebody out on
 *    the strength of a conversation they did not get through is the false
 *    confidence the readiness screen is built against.
 * 8. **Try it again**, which is one button, because the second run is where
 *    most of the learning is.
 *
 * No score anywhere on this screen. That is not an omission.
