 * The debrief, and the order is the argument (§12).

 * 2. **What you got done**: the required beats, ticked. A count of things
 *    achieved, never a percentage, because a mark on a conversation is a claim
 *    about somebody's Estonian and only the mock exam may make one (ADR-022).
 * 3. **How it went**, which is the review a teacher gives after a role-play:
 *    it leads on how much of what you said was understood, and then names
 *    each ending that came out as something else, what that ending is for,
 *    and your own words beside the ones the other side used. English, and
 *    derived from the transcript rather than written here
 *    (`lib/scenes/review.ts`).
 * 4. **The words you needed and did not have**, each with an add-to-deck
 *    button, from the help button and from the beats that stalled.
 * 5. **One thing to work on**, as a `DrillLink` into the drill that addresses
 *    it, rather than advice this screen wrote itself, and only where there is
 *    a drill: the goal itself is already ticked off at 2.
 * 6. **What was said**, both sides, which is the record. §12 of the design
 *    had it third and gave as its reason the job 3 does now, that this is
 *    where a learner finds out the word they were sure of was not the word.
 *    The transcript marks nothing, and it is the one section here with no
 *    bound on its length, so it sits under the things a learner can act on
 *    rather than between them and the outcome
 *    (`docs/21-situations.md` §12, amendment 1).
 * 7. **The real one.** The errand this scene rehearses, and where the people
 *    are. This is the screen a learner is on the moment they have just proved
 *    they can book the appointment, and it used to end in "have it again":
 *    the purpose of the app is to be left (`docs/22-real-life.md`), and a
 *    rehearsal that ends in another rehearsal keeps somebody inside. Shown
 *    only where every required beat was met, because sending somebody out on
 *    the strength of a conversation they did not get through is the false
 *    confidence the readiness screen is built against.
 * 8. **Try it again**, which is one button, because the second run is where
 *    most of the learning is.
 *
 * No score anywhere on this screen. That is not an omission.

        THE RECORD, AFTER THE TEACHING RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF IT.

        pixels, and it sat between the outcome and every actionable thing
        under it, so the teaching, the words to keep and the way back in were
        all below the fold on a conversation that had barely started.
