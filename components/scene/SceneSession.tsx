/**
 * One conversation, from the desk to the debrief.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO METERS (§7). No progress bar, no timer, no patience gauge: every
 * one of those turns this into a game about the gauge. Pressure is carried in
 * what the other person says, and when their patience runs out they say so and
 * move on. What stays on screen is the role card and the objectives, because
 * knowing what you came in to get done is not a hint, it is what somebody
 * walking into a health center already knows.
 *
 * THE SERVER MARKS EVERY TURN. This sends what has been typed and is told what
 * the other side says back; it never decides whether a turn landed. That is
 * ADR-022's split, and it is why the same function marks the run again when it
 * ends: two markers would be two answers to "were you understood", and the one
 * nobody watches is the one that drifts.
 *
 * A REPLY IS A FEW LINES, NOT ONE. The other side reacts to what was said and
 * then makes their move (`lib/scenes/reply.ts`), so what arrives is a list:
 * "Hästi." and then the next question, or "Ma ei saa aru" and the same
 * question again, or "Jah?" on its own while they wait for the rest of a
 * sentence. Each line still carries where it came from (ADR-025), and a line
 * of English about what they did is drawn as a stage direction rather than as
 * a bubble, because it is not something anybody said.
 *
 * YOU CAN WALK OUT. Leaving is a real option in a real conversation, and the
 * debrief handles it without a word of reproach.

            in it, and the answer was on the screen all along in `beatId`: the
            beat the other side is waiting on. So the objective in play is
            named, in words as well as in weight, and the count says how many
            are behind you.

            A count of things done is not a meter (§7). There is no bar, no
            timer and nothing draining: it is the same ticks added up, which
            is the reading the debrief is allowed to give and the one somebody
            glancing at a list wants without counting it themselves.
