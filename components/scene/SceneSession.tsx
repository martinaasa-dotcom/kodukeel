/**
 * One conversation, from the desk to the debrief.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO METERS (§7). No progress bar, no timer, no patience gauge: every
 * one of those turns this into a game about the gauge. Pressure is carried in
 * what the other person says, and when their patience runs out they say so and
 * move on. What stays on screen is the role card and the objectives, because
 * knowing what you came in to get done is not a hint, it is what somebody
 * walking into a health center already knows.
 *
 * THE SERVER MARKS EVERY TURN. This sends what has been typed and is told what
 * the other side says back; it never decides whether a turn landed. That is
 * ADR-022's split, and it is why the same function marks the run again when it
 * ends: two markers would be two answers to "were you understood", and the one
 * nobody watches is the one that drifts.
 *
 * A REPLY IS A FEW LINES, NOT ONE. The other side reacts to what was said and
 * then makes their move (`lib/scenes/reply.ts`), so what arrives is a list:
 * "Hästi." and then the next question, or "Ma ei saa aru" and the same
 * question again, or "Jah?" on its own while they wait for the rest of a
 * sentence. Each line still carries where it came from (ADR-025), and a line
 * of English about what they did is drawn as a stage direction rather than as
 * a bubble, because it is not something anybody said.
 *
 * YOU CAN WALK OUT. Leaving is a real option in a real conversation, and the
 * debrief handles it without a word of reproach.
