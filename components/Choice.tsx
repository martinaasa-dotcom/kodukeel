/**
 * THE ONE SELECTABLE OPTION, BECAUSE THERE WERE THREE AND NONE OF THEM LOOKED
 * PRESSABLE.
 *
 * Settings, first run and the daily goal all asked the same shape of question —
 * pick one of these, or pick some of these — and each answered it differently.
 * The worst of them, and the one this module was written for, was a bare
 * `<button>` wrapped round a `<Chip>`: the chip is a *label* primitive, so the
 * control had no border, no shadow, no hover and no press. Three things were
 * wrong at once and they compound:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing said it could be clicked.** A chip is what the dictionary uses
 *    to say "B1" and "verb". Eight of them in a row under a heading read as a
 *    legend, so a first-run learner is looking at the one screen that decides
 *    their year and cannot tell that it is a form.
 * 2. **Nothing said which one was chosen.** Selection swapped `--raised` for
 *    `--accent-soft`. On the dark theme those are `#221e36` and `#2a2350`,
 *    which is a hue shift of almost no luminance: the palette's own rule is
 *    that a color may not be the only thing carrying a distinction, and here
 *    it was carrying the *answer*.
 * 3. **A screen reader was told the wrong thing.** Eight mutually exclusive
 *    options were eight `aria-pressed` toggle buttons, so the group announced
 *    as eight separate switches and cost eight tab stops, rather than as one
 *    radio group saying "3 of 8".
 *
 * So: resting is a surface with a rule and a small shadow, which is exactly how
 * `Button variant="secondary"` says "press me"; hover moves the border to the
 * accent and lifts a pixel; `press` dips on click; and selected inverts to a
 * solid accent fill. The inversion is a *luminance* change rather than a hue
 * change, which is what keeps it legible to somebody who cannot separate the
 * two hues, and the card variant adds a tick on top of it.
 *
 * The semantics come from the group rather than the option, because "one of
 * these" and "any of these" are different controls and only the group knows
 * which it is.

 * `aria-pressed` actually means.
