/**
 * THE DATE THEY GAVE US, AND WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT.
 *
 * Somebody says at first run that they want B1 by March. Two numbers side by
 * side are what make that a decision: forty-seven days and sixty-two percent is
 * a different feeling from forty-seven days and thirty-one.
 *
 * IT LIVES ON THE EXAMINATION HUB, AND IT USED TO BE ON TODAY. A forecast is
 * not a thing to do in the next ten minutes, and Today has six boxes for the
 * things that are; the hub is the page somebody with a date is already going
 * to. What it replaced there was the same card assembled by hand out of the
 * same four figures, so this is one drawing of them rather than two.
 *
 * AND WHERE NOBODY NAMED A BAND, THE CARD SAYS WHOSE IT IS. Skipping the goal
 * screen used to mean no confidence figure anywhere on the home page, which is
 * the one number here that answers "how am I doing" in a unit somebody outside
 * this app would recognize. `examCountdown` falls back to the level the climb
 * stopped at and `chosen` travels with it, so the heading and the line under
 * the ring both change: a band the app worked out is never printed under a
 * heading claiming the learner picked it.
 *
 * THE TIER IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IS NOT A TOOLTIP. A confidence figure with no
 * account of what it rests on is the one thing this feature must not ship
 * (ADR-022), and a `title` attribute is a hover, which is nothing at all on the
 * phone this app is measured on. So it is printed, in words, under the number,
 * from the same table the examination hub reads.
 *
 * The color is a claim rather than decoration: mint means "you would pass"
 * and the accent means "not yet", which is the palette's own rule about a hue
 * carrying meaning, and the percentage says the same thing in digits so the
 * color is never the only channel.
