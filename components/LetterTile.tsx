/**
 * ONE OF THE FOUR LETTERS AN ENGLISH KEYBOARD HAS NOT GOT, TUCKED OVER A CARD.
 *
 * The ornament that was four spans of Tailwind on the landing page and is now
 * one component, because the moment they answer a pointer they need a listener
 * and a measurement, and four copies of a listener is four places for the
 * `removeEventListener` to be forgotten.
 *
 * TWO ELEMENTS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING. The outer one is placed and leans;
 * the inner one wanders. A keyframe and a transition cannot share a property,
 * so a lean written onto the same element as the wander is a lean that never
 * happens. See `app/globals.css` for the pairing and why the suite that guards
 * the placement can still see both halves of it.
 *
 * IT IS ALWAYS TUCKED OVER AN EDGE, and the type says so rather than the
 * comment. A letter with room on every side was tried, out in the landing
 * page's margins where the reading column does not reach, and it is not what
 * this ornament is: these belong to the card whose contents are the letters
 * themselves, and one drifting in the margin beside a headline is a decoration
 * that has come loose. So `edge` is not optional, which is what deletes the
 * branch of `leanFor` that could move a letter on both axes at once.
 *
 * IT MEASURES ITSELF ONCE, NOT ON EVERY MOVE. `getBoundingClientRect` in a
 * pointermove handler is a forced layout per event per letter, which is the
 * fault `lib/layout/navMarker.ts` was rewritten to stop making. The rectangle
 * is read on mount and again when the page scrolls or resizes, and a move is
 * then arithmetic. It is stale for at most a frame of a scroll, which for a
 * decoration is nothing.
 *
 * BOTH ELEMENTS ARE POSITIONED, and the inner one has to be. Every suite that
 * measures whether something is inside its box or drawn over something else
 * skips an element that positions itself, on the argument that a corner badge
 * or a decorative wash was put where it is deliberately. It reads the position
 * of the element itself rather than of its ancestors, so a letter whose tile
 * sat statically inside a placed wrapper would be walked as ordinary text
 * lying across a card. `inset-0` is what keeps it a decoration.
 *
 * IT HEARS THE CARD. When the word under the letters changes the explorer
 * says so on `document` (`LETTER_CHEER_EVENT`), and every tile hops once, a
 * beat after the one before it. The hop is on the wrapper rather than the
 * tile, as `scale` and `rotate`, which are the two properties the wrapper's
 * lean does not use: put on the tile it would replace the wander's animation
 * for its duration and restart it after, and a letter that jumps back to the
 * start of its amble every time somebody presses a chip is a letter on a
 * spring. The attribute goes on when the event lands and comes off when the
 * hop ends, so a second press mid-hop restarts it rather than being lost.
 *
 * `aria-hidden` and `pointer-events-none`, always. These are letters lying on
 * a page, not content and not controls: a screen reader that reads them out
 * says "õ ä ö ü" in the middle of a sentence about the partitive, and one that
 * took a pointer event would be a decoration swallowing a tap meant for the
 * card underneath it.

/**
 * A hue's fill and its ink, which are two tokens and one character apart.
 *
 * Written out rather than built from the hue's name, because the accent is the
 * one that breaks the pattern: `--accent-ink` is the white that goes on the
 * solid button, and the ink for a word on `--accent-soft` is `--accent-deep`.
 * A tile that built its own token names would have painted that one white on
 * lilac. Peach is not here at all: it means "missed" on every other screen in
 * the app, and a decoration may not spend a color that carries a meaning.
