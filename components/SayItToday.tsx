/**
 * Whether any Estonian was spoken to a real person yesterday, and a small
 * thing to say today where the answer is no.
 *
 * THE QUESTION IS ABOUT A DAY THAT IS OVER. This card used to set an errand
 * in the morning and put the three answers underneath it, which asked for a
 * report on something that had not happened yet: at eight in the morning
 * those are not three answers, they are three ways to make a card go away.
 * And it could only see conversations this app had set, so a learner who
 * spent an hour with their Estonian mother-in-law and ignored the errand was
 * recorded as having done nothing, in the one number this app says it is
 * measured by.
 *
 * So it asks first and offers second. The three answers are the whole of what
 * is asked: no note, no where, no who, because a report that costs one press
 * is one a person makes. The switch to English is the only detail worth a
 * word, because it is the thing being practiced against, and "not yesterday"
 * is worded as a day that happened rather than as a failing, which is also
 * why it is answered with an errand instead of with encouragement.
