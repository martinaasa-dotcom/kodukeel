/**
 * WHICH WORDS ARE KNOWN, WHICH ARE NEARLY, AND WHICH KEEP GOING WRONG.
 *
 * The deck could say a word was due or not due and nothing else. This is the
 * other reading, asked for directly: a mastered list, an almost list, and a
 * needs-work list, so somebody can see what they have actually got rather than
 * only what the scheduler wants from them today.
 *
 * COUNTED IN WORDS, NOT CARDS, which is what makes it different from the deck
 * tiles above it on the same page. Those count cards and read the FSRS state,
 * so one word contributes four or five rows and "Known" means "this card's
 * interval is long". A learner does not think in cards. `masteryOf` is the
 * rule and it is about the word: five correct answers across three different
 * forms, with the most recent one right.
 *
 * The tiers open one at a time and start closed. Four lists of sixty words
 * unrolled on a page somebody opened to see a number is a wall, and the counts
 * are the part that gets read.
