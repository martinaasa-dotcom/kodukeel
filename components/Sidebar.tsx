/**
 * The rail, and the phone bar under it.
 *
 * Every destination is on the rail, all the time, under the heading for the
 * question it answers. There is no "More" here and there is nothing behind it.
 *
 * There used to be. Four links were promoted, the other twelve sat behind a
 * disclosure, and it had a bug you only met once you used the app: the group
 * opened itself whenever the current page was inside it, so on Practice or
 * Progress or Grammar the button read "Less" and pressing it did nothing.
 * `showRest` was `railOpen || secondaryActive`, the click flipped `railOpen`,
 * and the second half of that held the rail open regardless.
 *
 * Fixing the toggle was the small half of the fix. Sixteen links behind a
 * button marked "More" are not fewer links, they are the same links somewhere
 * you have to remember; four headings over the same sixteen are four short
 * answers to "where do I go for this", and they cost nothing to read past.
 * `lib/ux/nav.ts` is the one table of what goes where, and the phone sheet and
 * the command palette read it too, so a new screen cannot arrive on two of the
 * three surfaces.
 *
 * Routes that own the whole screen — the landing page, sign-in, first-run
 * setup — live in `app/(chromeless)/` and never render this at all, which is
 * why there is no path list here to keep in sync.

        The desktop rail. Two boxes rather than one, and the split is the
        whole point.

        Every destination plus four headings and a rule comes to more than a
        laptop is tall, so this column has always scrolled. The scroll was on
        the nav itself, which meant the wordmark went with it: reach the
        bottom of the list and the app's own name has left the screen, and the
        one fixed thing in the layout is the piece that moved. It stays put
        now. The nav holds the height and no longer scrolls, the wordmark is
        its first child, and the list below it is the scroll container.

        Split rather than `position: sticky` on the wordmark, because a sticky
        header has to hide what passes beneath it and there is nothing here to
        hide it with. This rail is transparent over the fixed pastel wash, so a
        solid fill behind the wordmark would be a flat rectangle sitting on a
        gradient, and the one thing that hides a moving backdrop without a fill
        is a `backdrop-filter`, which this app does not put over moving content
        (see the phone bar below). A second scroll container costs none of
        that: the rows are simply clipped at its top edge, which is what every
        other scroller in the app already does.

          The list, and the well the marker is measured against.

          `min-h-0` is what makes this scroll at all: a flex item's automatic
          minimum is its content, so without it the list sets the height of a
          column that is already fixed to the screen and nothing overflows
          anywhere. `-mr-4` gives the scrollbar back the nav's own right
          padding, so the thumb sits at the edge of the rail rather than
          floating a centimetre inside it; `.scroll-host` then puts the rows
          back a comfortable distance from it.

          THE WELL AND THE SCROLL CONTAINER HAVE TO BE THE SAME BOX. The panes
          are placed by `offsetTop` and drawn absolutely, so they travel with
          the rows only while the rows' offset parent is the thing that
          scrolls; hang them off the nav instead and the pill stays where the
          window is while the row it names slides out from under it. That was
          free when the nav was itself the scroller. It is not free now, so
          this box takes it on: `relative` to be the offset parent the cells
          measure from, and `isolate` for the stacking context that keeps a
          `z-index: -1` pane behind the rows rather than behind the page. The
          nav's own `sticky` used to be quietly supplying both.

        Phone bar: four destinations plus everything else behind one button, so
        no tap target is smaller than a thumb. Floating, so it reads as a
        control rather than the edge of the page.

        This one keeps its "More" and the rail does not, because the constraint
        is different: a rail is a column with a screen of height in it and a bar
        is five cells across a phone. What the button opens is not a heap
        though. It is the same sections the rail shows, with the same headings,
        so the two surfaces answer "where does this live" the same way.

        NO BACKDROP FILTER ON IT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE REASON IT IS OPAQUE.
        An element that is `position: fixed`, carries a `backdrop-filter` and
        sits over content that moves has to re-filter its backdrop on every
        frame of every scroll, and the bottom band of the window is exactly
        where new content arrives while somebody is scrolling. Upside Lab
        measured the same pairing on its landing page at 412x915 with the CPU
        throttled ten times: one pass down the page presented 42 frames the
        compositor had to repaint, the worst of them with 38% of the bottom
        eighth of the screen not yet caught up with where the page actually
        was. Hiding that one element took the same scroll to 9 frames, every
        one of them pixel-identical to the settled page.

        So the rule is the pair rather than either half: nothing in this app
        may be fixed over the content and carry a backdrop filter. The bar
        reads the same at a solid fill, since what was behind it was a pastel
        wash rather than anything to be read through.

        The bottom offset is `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` and not a number:
        installed to a home screen this app runs under the notch and over the
        home indicator (`viewport-fit=cover` in app/layout.tsx asks for that),
        and `bottom-3` put the bar on top of the indicator.

          reads a bounding rectangle, which a transform changes: the bar
          swelling three percent while the window happened to be resizing
          would publish a clearance three percent too tall to everything that
          sits clear of it. The nav lays out and is measured, the capsule
          inside it is what scales, and the two are the same size whenever
          anybody asks.

          `isolate` is load-bearing too. The panes sit at a negative z-index
          so the cells can stay unpositioned and keep reporting their offsets
          against this element; with no stacking context here they would fall
          behind the capsule's own fill and never be seen again.

 * It paints no background of its own in either state now. The card the
 * current row used to draw for itself is one pane that the marker places, and
 * a row that also painted itself would be a second answer to the same
 * question arriving a beat later. What is left here is what a pane cannot
 * say: which row is bold, and which glyph wears its own color. Those two are
 * also the whole of what tells the row you are on from the row you are
 * pointing at, since both now carry the same pane; see `app/nav.css`.
 *
 * The ink reads `--nav-ink` rather than naming its resting color, because an
 * inline style beats a class hover, silently, which is the mechanism that
 * left half the controls in this app dead under a pointer. A custom property
 * is how a caller passes a tone *through* one, and `app/nav.css` spends it
 * when the pointer's pane arrives underneath.
