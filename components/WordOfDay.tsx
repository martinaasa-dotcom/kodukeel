/**
 * ONE WORD A DAY, WITH A REASON, THAT THE REST OF THE APP IS NOT GOING TO SHOW
 * YOU ANYWAY.
 *
 * Every other panel on Today reports on the learner's own deck, which means
 * every other panel goes quiet on the first morning and repeats itself on the
 * four hundredth. This one comes out of the dictionary, so it works on day one,
 * and it is chosen by the date, so it is different tomorrow whatever anybody
 * did today.
 *
 * The reason is the whole panel. `pannkook` on its own is a vocabulary item and
 * gets scrolled past; `pannkook` under "Pancake Day" is a thing somebody tells
 * a friend at lunch. `lib/copy/almanac.ts` decides what today is,
 * `lib/progress/wordOfDay.ts` asks the dictionary who carries the meaning, and
 * this prints what came back.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO IS INVENT ONE. When the dictionary cannot meet any of the
 * day's requests the word is simply drawn, and the card says that instead of
 * dressing it up. A reason nobody can check is worse than no reason, and the
 * day the card claims pancakes over the word for a cupboard is the day nobody
 * reads it again.
