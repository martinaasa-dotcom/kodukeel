/*
  Pull the page down to ask for it again.

  WHY THIS IS WRITTEN BY HAND RATHER THAN LEFT TO THE BROWSER. The browser has
  a pull to refresh of its own and this app switched it off, in globals.css,
  on purpose: `overscroll-behavior-y: none` is what stops a rubber band
  dragging the desktop rail away from the top of the window and sliding the
  phone bar half off at the other end. That property is the same switch for
  both things, so there is no setting that returns the gesture and keeps the
  chrome still. The bounce had to go, and this is the bounce put back under
  our own control, moving the one element that should move.

  AND WHY THE GESTURE IS WORTH HAVING IN A FLASHCARD APP. Installed to a home
  screen this runs with no address bar, so there is no reload button anywhere
  in it, and two screens tell a learner something they cannot act on: the
  offline banner says grades are still waiting to be sent, and Today shows a
  due count worked out when the page was rendered. A reading you can ask to
  be re-taken is a reading you can trust; one that only ever tells you is one
  you have to take on faith. The pull is what turns both of those from a
  notice into an answer.

  IT COSTS NOTHING WHEN NOBODY IS PULLING. There is one passive `touchstart`
  listener on the document, and it is only attached on a device with a coarse
  pointer at all. `touchmove` is attached when a touch begins somewhere a pull
  could start from and removed when it ends, so most of the time the document
  has no move listener on it whatsoever. Nothing here ever calls
  `preventDefault`, which is what lets every listener be passive: at the top
  of a page whose overscroll is already `none`, a downward drag scrolls
  nothing, so there is nothing to prevent.

  AND ALMOST NOTHING WHILE SOMEBODY IS. Moves are coalesced into one
  `requestAnimationFrame` write per frame. That write sets a `transform` and
  an `opacity`, which the compositor handles without laying anything out or
  painting it, plus one dash offset on a 22px circle. There is not a single
  React render between the finger going down and the work starting.

  THE RING IS `position: fixed` AND CARRIES NO BACKDROP FILTER, and those two
  facts belong together. A pull is by definition content moving under
  something pinned to the window, which is exactly the pairing measured at 42
  repainted frames on Upside Lab's landing page. Fixed is fine on its own.

  Borrowed from Upside Lab with the same curve and the same ring, because the
  numbers are the part that was arrived at rather than chosen.

  WHAT A PULL ACTUALLY ASKS FOR HERE.

  Two things. First the offline queue is told to try again, because a grade
  that has not reached the server is the only thing in this app that can
  actually be lost, and a banner that reports one while offering no way to
  retry is most of why this gesture earns its place. Then the router is asked
  for the page again, which re-runs the server components: the due count, the
  streak, the day's ring and every chart are derived from the append-only
  review log on each request, so one fresh render is a fresh answer to all of
  them at once.

  KNOWING WHEN THAT HAS FINISHED IS THE HARD HALF, AND THE OBVIOUS ANSWER DOES
  NOT WORK. `startTransition(() => router.refresh())` with `useTransition`'s
  `isPending` is the documented recipe, and measured on this app it goes true
  and never comes back: the request goes out, the server answers in about
  20ms, React commits, and the flag stays set. Built on that, the ring turned
  for the full eight second ceiling on every single pull, which is the app
  telling somebody it is still trying long after it has finished. That is
  worse than not having the gesture, and it is exactly the failure the
  ceiling exists to bound rather than to be reached.

  So the signal is the one thing here that is genuinely observable from the
  page: the router's own request for the new tree, seen landing. It is a
  `GET` carrying `_rsc`, and its resource timing entry is written when the
  response is complete. That is a real answer to "has the server answered",
  measured rather than inferred, and it is why this reads the network instead
  of asking React.
