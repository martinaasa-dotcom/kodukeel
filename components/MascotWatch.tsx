/**
 * The mark, leaning toward the pointer.
 *
 * A separate client component rather than a flag inside `Mascot`, because the
 * mark is drawn on nearly every screen in the app and a pointer listener does
 * not belong in any of them. This one is used where the mark is large and is
 * the thing you are looking at: the landing page's closing panel and sign-in.
 *
 * The tilde is moved by two custom properties on the wrapper. They inherit
 * down into the SVG, so nothing here reaches into the mark's own geometry, and
 * the mark stays one drawing shared with the icon files.
 *
 * The travel is capped at a few units, under a pixel of the tilde: further and
 * the stroke looks loose on its tile. And it settles once the pointer is a few
 * hundred pixels away rather than tracking to the edge of the screen, because
 * a mark that keeps leaning from across a page is restless rather than
 * friendly.
