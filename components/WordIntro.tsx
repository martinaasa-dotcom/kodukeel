/**
 * A WORD'S FIRST OUTING: WHAT IT MEANS, AND IT DOING ITS JOB IN A SENTENCE
 * SOMEBODY ACTUALLY WROTE.
 *
 * The sentence is the part that does the work. A gloss makes a word a label,
 * and a word in a sentence is a word you have seen behave. It is attested
 * Estonian picked by `teachingSentence`, with the form the learner is about to
 * be asked for marked in it, and nothing here is written or derived (ADR-005).
 *
 * AND A SENTENCE NOBODY CAN READ TEACHES NOTHING, which is what this screen
 * was for most words. Ekilex records no English on a reader key, so the usual
 * first meeting was one glossed word inside six that were not, and it was
 * reported that way. Two answers, and they are different answers rather than
 * two goes at one. Word by word is the one that always works and costs
 * nothing: `lib/dict/glossed.ts` puts the dictionary's own headword and gloss
 * under every word it will vouch for, offline, with no key and no call, and a
 * word the learner does not have can be kept from there. The whole sentence in
 * English is the other, and it is a paid call to a model translating *into*
 * English, which is the direction ADR-005 permits, so it is asked for rather
 * than spent on every word somebody meets. It is tagged where it lands, and
 * `translateExample` stores it on the sentence, so the next learner to meet
 * this word reads it for free.
 *
 * One component rather than one per screen, and that is what it is for. Review
 * had this drawing and Learn needs the same one: two copies would be two
 * answers to how a word is introduced, and the one nobody was looking at would
 * be the one that stopped saying where its sentence came from.
