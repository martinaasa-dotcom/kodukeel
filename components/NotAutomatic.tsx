/**
 * THE TWO THINGS AN ACCURACY CHART CANNOT SAY.
 *
 * Every other panel on this page counts answers. This one reads the two
 * columns that were being written and never read: how long an answer took, and
 * which form came back instead of the one asked for.
 *
 * They are drawn together because they are one story. "You get the seesütlev
 * right nine times in ten, and it takes you four seconds" and "you and the
 * seestütlev keep swapping places" are the same finding twice: a rule being
 * applied rather than a word being reached for. Split across two cards on a
 * page that already carries eight charts, neither would be read.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT REPEAT THE CASES PANEL. `WeakestCases` sits directly above and
 * names what is *wrong*; `FLUENT_ACCURACY` keeps this to what is right. A
 * learner reading both gets two different instructions, which is the only
 * reason to print two panels about one subject.
 *
 * BUTTER, BECAUSE THE SCHEDULER ALREADY CALLED IT THAT. A slow correct answer
 * is a Hard, and the palette has one hue for "nearly" (docs/14-design-system.md
 * section 1). Inventing a sixth to mean "right but slow" is what that document
 * forbids, and mint would say recalled, which overstates it.
