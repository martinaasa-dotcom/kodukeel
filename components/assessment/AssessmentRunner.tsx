/**
 * Sitting the check.
 *
 * The paper arrives built (`lib/progress/assessment.ts` reads the dictionary,
 * `lib/assessment/items.ts` shapes it) and is snapshotted on mount, so a
 * refresh of the page underneath cannot swap a question out while it is being
 * read. Which question comes next is decided by `nextCursor`, which is a pure
 * function of the paper and the answers so far: a skill asks at most one band
 * above the first band it was not passed at, and nothing at all above one that
 * collapsed. That is what keeps an eighty question paper from being eighty
 * questions for a beginner.
 *
 * Two things it deliberately does not do. It does not grade any card, because
 * the words in it are chosen for *not* being in the learner's deck and grading
 * them would write scheduling history for cards that do not exist. And it does
 * not score the speaking section, because nothing in this app may.

        and cannot be heard: a device muted, or a browser that blocked the
        first play. Nothing can detect that, which is why the button has to
        exist. What it must not be is a neutral option under every listening
        question, which is how it read: one press drops a scored skill, and
        `overallFrom` averages what is left, so the level a learner is then
        shown rests on two thirds of the paper. The line says so now.

        What this does not do is wait until the learner has pressed play. That
        is the honest gate and it needs a signal `Speak` does not send.
