/**
 * The result, said plainly.
 *
 * Four numbers and a paragraph of caveats, in that order, because the caveats
 * are the part that makes the numbers usable. A learner told "you are B1" by an
 * app they met half an hour ago will either believe it and sit an exam they fail,
 * or disbelieve it and ignore everything else here. Told "reading looks B1,
 * writing looks A2, from nine questions, which is thin", they have something
 * they can actually use.

            Not a measurement of your speaking. Nothing here can honestly score how you say
            Estonian, so the speaking line is only how confident you said you felt. It is left
            out of the level.

            Not a measurement of conversation. Nothing here talks back to you at real speed, and

          <li>
            Built from this dictionary. Every word and sentence came from the same set the rest
            of the app teaches from. That is broad, but it is not the whole language.
