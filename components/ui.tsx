 * tall the word of the day turned out. Reading order is unchanged, down the
 * first column and then down the second, which is the order the children are
 * given in. A card never splits across the seam, and every card keeps the
 * rhythm `Stack` sets between sections.

    Ninety-two call sites cannot each be asked to know how long their own
    label might get, and the one that was asked had already been caught. So
