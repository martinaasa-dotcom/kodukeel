/**
 * The cases a learner keeps missing, worst first, with a way in to each.
 *
 * There were three of these. Progress drew bars with a question mark beside
 * them, Practice drew the same bars with a different width and label, and My
 * words drew its own smaller version with a sprint link under it. Worse than
 * the markup: My words tallied the reviews itself in a local function instead
 * of calling `caseAccuracy`, so the same learner could read two different
 * numbers for the same case on two screens, and nothing in the app would
 * disagree with either.
 *
 * It carries `tap-tint` because a row here is a control: it tints and lifts
 * under the pointer rather than fading, which is what every other selectable
 * option in the app does since the sweep that made them look selectable. That
 * arrived on main while this component was being extracted, on two of the three
 * copies it replaces, so it is ported here rather than lost to a clean merge.
 *
 * One component, one calculation, and the best of the three affordances kept:
 * two destinations per row, because the bar drills a case and the question mark
 * explains it. Side by side rather than stacked, since drilling a case you have
 * not understood yet only fails faster, so the way out has to be visible
 * without turning the list into two lines per case.

          actually names it.

                AND THE QUESTION IT ANSWERS, WHICH A READER COULD NOT SEE.

                The name leads, which is the rule, and the question a class
                actually uses to name a case was carried by `title` and
                `aria-label` alone. A `title` is a hover, this app is measured
                at 360, and this panel is on Today, on Progress and on
                Practice, so on the three screens a beginner sees most a case
                was a word in a language they are learning with a percentage
                beside it and nothing to hold onto. That is the same fault the
                dictation notes were fixed for: a tooltip is not text.

                `asksThing` and `asksWhere` rather than `question`, which is
                all three pronouns and does not fit: what a teacher writes on
                the board is `kus?`, and the person form is the one a word
                decides, which this panel has no word to ask. Under the name
                rather than beside it, so the row grows a line instead of a
                column: the comment below records that this row had 37px to
                give back at 768 and it does not have them now either.
