/**
 * THE WORDS THE LEARNER KEPT, WHICH IS THE ONE LIST ON THIS PAGE THEY WROTE
 * THEMSELVES.
 *
 * Every other list here is derived: the four tiers are `masteryOf` reading the
 * review log, and a word arrives in one of them because of how it was
 * answered. This one is a decision somebody made, one press at a time, on the
 * card the word was in front of them on. So it leads, above the counts, rather
 * than sitting under four lists of sixty words: a list somebody has to scroll
 * to find is the fault this page exists to correct, and it was reported twice
 * before the page was built.
 *
 * THE STAR IS ON EACH ROW BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO WHERE ONE COMES OFF. A list you
 * can only add to fills up and stops being a shortlist, and the row a learner
 * wants to drop is the row they are looking at.
 *
 * The star is beside the link rather than inside it: a button nested in a link
 * is neither, and a press on it would follow the link on some browsers.
