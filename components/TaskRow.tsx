    date is typed into `<input type="date">` and stored at midnight UTC, so a
    task due today was already "Overdue" at three in the morning in Tallinn, and
    at midnight anywhere. Something due today is due today.

    the browser's, which is the learner's. That is the one place in this app
    where reaching for the process clock is the correct thing to do.
