/**
 * HOW PEOPLE ACTUALLY TALK, AS A TABLE.
 *
 * Every listening exercise in this app used to play one clean synthetic
 * voice at a normal speed in a silent room, and nobody a learner will ever
 * meet talks like that. The receptionist is quick, the shop is noisy, the
 * clinic rings you back on a bad line, and half the sentences you meet on a
 * bus you catch from the middle. An ear trained on studio audio freezes on all
 * four, which is the moment this app exists to prepare somebody for.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MAY AND MAY NOT MAKE IMPERFECT. The words stay exactly what the
 * dictionary says. Mumbled spellings, dropped endings and slang would be this
 * project writing Estonian, and a form the app invented is a form the
 * scheduler drills (ADR-005). So every condition here is about the *delivery*
 * of a sentence a lexicographer recorded: how fast it is said, which of twelve
 * voices says it, what is going on around it, and how much of it you caught.
 * Nothing about the text changes, and the screen says which condition it was
 * once the answer is shown, because a learner who did not catch a word wants
 * to know whether it was the word or the room.
 *
 * WHY A TABLE. `lib/audio/clip.ts` builds every cache key, the browser mixer
 * applies every effect, and two rounds choose a condition per card. Three
 * places agreeing on what "café" means is three places to disagree, so this is
 * the one list and each of them reads it.
 *
 * THE POOL WIDENS AS THE WORD SETTLES, which is the flash round's rule about
 * its shapes: the first time a word is heard it is heard cleanly, and each
 * time the scheduler brings it back and it is still known, the next condition
 * opens. A word you have met twice is not yet a word to hear down a phone.
 *
 * Pure: strings and numbers in, strings and numbers out. The mixer that turns
 * a condition into sound is `lib/audio/mixer.ts`, browser only.

 * In a shop you do not get the subtitles. Every line the other side says in a

 * one thing that actually breaks down at a counter, catching it the first time
 * at somebody's own speed, was the one thing a rehearsal never rehearsed. With
 * this on, the line is spoken and the text waits behind a press.
 *
 * OFF BY DEFAULT, which is the ordinary rule about a missing row rather than
 * the exception `DEFAULT_HEARING` makes: this is harder than what everybody
 * has had, and a learner who arrives to find the words gone has been given a
 * different app than the one they left. Revealing costs nothing and is not
 * recorded: the point is to try first, not to be marked on it.

 * keep their length in that direction too. It is not asked of the service: a
 * speech model asked for a tempo holds every phoneme on repeated frames and
 * buzzes. 1.3 is brisk, not a caricature; the state examination's listening
 * texts are read at about that pace and a receptionist is faster.
 *
 * `cafe` is filtered noise at a level where the voice still leads. `phone`
 * keeps the 300 to 3400 Hz band a landline keeps, which is enough to lose the
 * difference between `s` and `f` and is exactly what happens on a call. `half`
 * starts two fifths of the way in, which is a sentence caught from the middle
 * of a conversation, and it is last because it is the only one that removes
 * words rather than coloring them. A condition with a room in it keeps the
 * normal rate, so that each condition changes one thing about the delivery
 * and the debrief can name it.
