/**
 * What is done to a clip between the speech service and the cache.
 *
 * TartuNLP answers with a WAV of 32-bit floats at 22,050 Hz and half a second
 * of digital silence on either side of every sentence, because the worker
 * concatenates a fixed pad round each one. For a word on a flashcard that is
 * the wrong shape twice over. Measured on `tuba`: 0.85 seconds of nothing,
 * then 0.39 seconds of speech, then 0.5 seconds of nothing, so a press on the
 * speaker button was followed by most of a second of silence before anything
 * was heard, which is the exact delay that makes a voice feel like a machine
 * warming up. And 32-bit float is a studio format for a signal that never
 * exceeds 16-bit precision on its way out of a vocoder: 88 KB a second, every
 * clip, stored for ever and shipped to every phone.
 *
 * So a clip is trimmed to a short lead and a natural release, faded at the
 * cuts so no edge clicks, its pauses capped at the length a speaker leaves,
 * leveled so every voice sits at the same loudness (Kalev's clips peaked at
 * 0.74 and Mari's at 0.66 for the same word, and a learner switching voice in
 * Settings should not have to reach for the volume key), and written as
 * 16-bit PCM, which halves the store, the egress and the service worker's
 * cache.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE CHANGES WHAT IS SAID OR HOW FAST. The samples inside the speech
 * are untouched but for a single gain. Speed is not applied here either: it
 * is applied at playback, in the browser, with the pitch held, because the
 * model's own slow setting stretches every phoneme on repeated frames and
 * sounds like it (see lib/audio/clip.ts).
 *
 * Pure. No Node, no Buffer, no React: it takes bytes and returns bytes, which
 * is what lets it be unit tested and what would let it run in a worker.

/**
 * HOW MUCH SILENCE SITS BEFORE THE FIRST SOUND AND AFTER THE LAST. EXACTLY
 * THIS MUCH, ON EVERY CLIP, WHATEVER THE SOURCE SENT.
 *
 * This used to be a maximum: the trim kept *up to* this much of whatever the
 * recording happened to have in front of the word, and a recording with less
 * got less. Measured over thirty real TartuNLP clips, the lead that actually
 * reached a learner ran from 40 ms on `ema`, `kass`, `tuba` and `õde` to 370 ms
 * on `pea`, decided by nothing but how long that clip's own vocoder hiss
 * happened to run before it crossed the floor. Two words in one round starting
 * a third of a second apart from the same press is the same fault as two
 * screens disagreeing about a figure, and the short end of that range is the
 * end that hurts: 40 ms is inside the window an output device swallows while
 * it opens a stream, and a word-initial consonant lives in exactly that window.
 * Nothing in the file was missing, and the first thing a learner heard of a
 * short word was its vowel.
 *
 * So it is a guarantee and not a ceiling. The padding is written here, as true
 * silence, and a source with less than this in front of its word is padded
 * rather than trusted. That is what makes it impossible for any one word to be
 * the exception, which is the only useful shape for this rule: the guarantee no
 * longer depends on what the recording contained. `lib/audio/stretch.ts` marks
 * the lead and the trail as padding and leaves them exactly as long as they
 * are, so a slow play keeps the same head start.
 *
 * The trail is longer than the lead on purpose. A final `s` is quiet, long and
 * falls away slowly, so a trail measured from the last loud frame has to reach
 * past the whole of it: at 160 ms `tingimus` came back as `tingimu`, reported
 * by a learner on the word's own first meeting, and a word cut short is a form
 * this app never taught. The lead only has to cover a device opening a stream,
 * which is why it is the shorter of the two: every millisecond of it is a
 * millisecond between the press and the word.

 * last, inside the worker's own half-second pad of true zeros. The first
 * trimmer looked at single samples against a floor of -44 dB, and the peaks
 * of that hiss reach -40, so it stopped at the hiss and kept the lot:
 * measured on `tuba`, the "40 ms lead" was 390 ms, and a press on the speaker
 * was followed by most of half a second of nothing, which is the delay this
 * trimmer was written to remove. Ten-millisecond frames measured as RMS put
 * the hiss at -50 dB and a word-final `s` at -34 to -38, so a floor at -42
