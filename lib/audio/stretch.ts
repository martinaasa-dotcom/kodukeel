/**
 * Slower, in the browser, the way a person is slower.
 *
 * A slow play is the one clip played at a lower rate with the pitch held. The
 * first version handed that to the browser's own `playbackRate`, and it was
 * reported as stretched and robotic anyway, for two reasons that are worth
 * keeping apart.
 *
 * THE BROWSER STRETCHES EVERYTHING BY THE SAME AMOUNT. A person speaking slowly
 * does not: vowels get longer, the pauses between words get much longer, and
 * the consonants stay where they were, because a `t` is a burst of air and a
 * slow `t` is not a longer burst, it is the same burst after a longer wait.
 * Multiply a plosive by 1.4 and you get a smeared double click; multiply a
 * fricative and the noise takes on a hum at the grain rate. That is the
 * "robotic" in the report, and no setting on the element reaches it, since
 * the element knows nothing about where the consonants are.
 *
 * AND WHAT THE BROWSER USES IS NOBODY'S CHOICE. Chrome has one algorithm,
 * Firefox another, Safari a third, and the grain size, the search width and
 * how each handles a transient are theirs to change in a release. A slow
 * play that sounds different on two phones is two answers to how slow is
 * done, which is the fault this module's one caller exists to prevent.
 *
 * So the stretch is done here, on the decoded samples, before the element
 * plays them. It is WSOLA, waveform-similarity overlap-add: short Hann
 * windows of the recording are laid down at a fixed output hop, and each one
 * is taken from wherever in a small neighborhood of its nominal input
 * position lines up best with the tail of the window before it. Because
 * every output sample is a sample of the recording, the pitch, the formants
 * and the voice are exactly the recording's own; only how long each part
 * lasts changes. The rate is not uniform: a short analysis pass marks each
 * ten milliseconds as silence, a transient, noise or a steady sound, and the
 * stretch is spent on the steady sounds and the pauses, not on the
 * transients, with the speech coming out at exactly the rate asked for.
 *
 * Pure. Float32Array in, Float32Array out, no Web Audio and no DOM, which is
 * what lets it be unit tested and measured against the real clips in Node.
 * `lib/audio/clip.ts` is the one caller, asserted, for the reason `new Audio(`
 * has one home: a second stretch is a second answer.
