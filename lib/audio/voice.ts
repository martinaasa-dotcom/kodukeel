/**
 * Which voice reads Estonian aloud, and whether it does so unasked.
 *
 * TartuNLP's speech service offers a dozen Estonian voices and this app used
 * one of them, chosen by whoever deployed it, for everybody. A learner who
 * finds one voice hard to follow had no way to change it, and a learner who
 * has only ever heard one voice say a word has learned that voice rather than
 * the word: the state examination's listening part is read by several
 * speakers, and so is the country.
 *
 * So the voice is a setting, and the list here is the allowlist the speech
 * route checks a request against: a value not on it is answered with the
 * default rather than passed to a third party as typed. The names are the
 * service's own identifiers, which is why one is spelled without its umlaut.
 *
 * Ten, not twelve. `lee` and `luukas` were on this list and are not in the
 * worker's own speaker table, and the live service answers a request for
 * either with a 408 after thirty seconds, measured twice on 2026-09-04. The
 * listening round cycles every voice on this list from word to word, so two
 * words in twelve waited out the route's timeout and took the speaker button
 * away. A voice is on this list because it answers.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no Prisma; the setting store holds the value and this says
 * what a valid one is.

/**
 * Whether a card reads itself aloud when it appears.
 *
 * **Off by default**, and that is a reversal worth writing down, because the
 * usual rule here is that a missing row reads as the behavior everybody
 * already had. This one deliberately changes under existing learners.
 *
 * The argument for `on` was that hearing a word every time it is met is the
 * cheapest thing an app can do for somebody learning a language whose spelling
 * only half records its length. That is still true, and it is not what the
 * setting was doing. A card reads itself aloud when the word is first met *and*
 * again when the answer appears, so a review session is a speaker firing twice
 * a card, unasked, on a phone in a room with other people in it. The learner
 * who wanted it got it; the learner who did not had to find Settings to stop
 * it, and the one who was somewhere they could not have sound reached for the
 * volume key instead and turned the whole thing off, including the feedback
 * tones.
 *
 * Silence is the safer default for the same reason a video does not autoplay
 * with sound: the cost of being wrong is asymmetric. A learner who wanted audio
 * and has silence presses a speaker icon, which is on every card. A learner who
 * did not want it and gets it is startled in a library.
 *
 * What pays for the flip is that the speaker is easy to reach rather than that
 * the sound is easy to stop: `SpeakPair` is a labeled control on the card, not
 * a hover target, and the setting is one chip in Settings for anybody who wants
 * the old behavior back.
