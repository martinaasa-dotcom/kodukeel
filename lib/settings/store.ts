 * separate `SELECT ... FROM "Setting" WHERE "ownerId" = $1` in one render.
 * The shell wants the letter bar and the timezone, `learnerDayClock` wants the
 * timezone again, `dailySummary` wants the daily goal, `resolveStreakFor`
 * wants the shields, the page wants four more, `courseLevelFor` wants the
 * placement and `wordOfDay` wants its own. Each is one indexed row and costs
 * nothing at all against a socket on the same machine; against a hosted
 * Postgres each is a round trip, and the round trips are the page.
 *

 * from that. Fifteen rows is the whole of what a learner has, which is smaller
 * than the eight `IN` lists it replaces.
 *
 * `cache()` is React's request-scoped memo and it holds the *container* rather
 * than the answer, which is what makes a write able to correct it: a Server
 * Action that stores a value and then reads it back in the same request has to
 * see what it just wrote, and `resolveStreakFor` banking a shield followed by
 * `awardBadges` reading the count is exactly that, on the busiest page here.
 * Outside a request React does not memoize at all, so a script, a test and a
 * seed get a fresh map per call and the old behavior with it.
