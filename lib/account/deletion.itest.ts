/**
 * Account deletion, against the database.
 *
 * The privacy page makes a specific promise about what disappears and what does
 * not. This checks the promise, table by table — a deletion that quietly misses
 * one of them is the kind of bug nobody notices until it matters.
 *
 * It runs the same statements `deleteMyAccount` runs; the action itself needs a
 * session. The list is kept in the same order so a new user-owned table added to
 * one and not the other is visible here.
 *
 * A LIST TYPED TWICE IS A LIST THAT DRIFTS, AND THIS ONE HAD. Three tables were
 * missing from the action and therefore from the copy of it below: mock exam
 * sittings, classes and class memberships. So the check that existed to catch a
 * missed table was written from the same missed list and agreed with it.
 *
 * The last test in this file is the one that could not have. It reads every
 * owner-scoped model out of the Prisma DMMF and asserts each is empty
 * afterwards, so a table added next year fails here without anybody adding a
 * line. `scripts/test-invariants.ts` does the same against the action's source.
