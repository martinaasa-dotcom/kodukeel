/*
  THE VOICE. ONE TABLE OF WHAT GIVES A SENTENCE AWAY AS GENERATED.

  Every screen in this app is one person explaining Estonian to another. That
  is not decoration. Somebody using this is usually also sitting in a class in
  Tallinn or reading a textbook at a kitchen table, and the moment a screen
  starts sounding like a product brochure they stop reading it the way they
  read their teacher. A learner skims marketing. They do not skim a teacher.

  The rule was already half here and in two places. `readerCopy.test.ts` swept
  the whole tree for a dash and swept six public files for nine brochure words;
  `humanize.ts` stripped a handful of stock openers out of Anu on the way past;
  `prompt.ts` asked the model for the same thing in its own words. Three lists,
  none of them the same, and the one that covered hand-written copy covered six
  files out of four hundred. So a phrase banned in Anu's answer was fine in the
  panel beside it.

  This is the one table. `readerCopy.test.ts` reads it to sweep hand-written
  copy, `humanize.ts` reads the rewritable subset to clean Anu's stream, and
  `prompt.ts` reads `VOICE_RULES` so what the model is asked for is what the
  sweep enforces. A copy of any of it living in one of those files is the fault
  this file exists to end, the same argument `PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` makes about
  itself.

  WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT DO. It catches the mechanical tells: a character, a
  phrase, a sentence shape. It cannot see whether a paragraph is warm, and it
  cannot see whether it is too long. Those are a review standard and they are
  written down in `docs/18-voice.md` with worked examples, because a rule with
  no example is a rule everybody reads as agreeing with what they already
  wrote. What is here is the half a machine can hold.

  ADDING ONE. A tell has to be a phrase that is never right on a screen in this
  app, not a word somebody dislikes. `perfect` is not on the list, because
  taisminevik is the perfect tense and a grammar page has to be able to say so.
  `unlock` is not on the list, because the exam recordings genuinely unlock.
  A tell that fires on honest copy gets waived, and a check everybody waives
  is a check nobody reads.
