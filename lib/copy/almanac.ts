  WHAT TODAY IS, AND WHICH ENGLISH WORD TO GO LOOKING FOR BECAUSE OF IT.

  Today's word of the day is drawn from the dictionary, and which word gets
  drawn is decided here, by the date. The twelfth of the month is a dozen. The
  fourteenth of February is Friend's Day in Estonia rather than Valentine's.
  The night before Lent is Pancake Day in England and a sledging day here, and
  it moves every year because Easter does. A word that arrives with a reason is
  a word somebody remembers, and a word drawn at random is furniture.

  THIS FILE IS ENGLISH AND CONTAINS NO ESTONIAN AT ALL, WHICH IS THE WHOLE
  DESIGN. Writing an Estonian word here would be this app inventing vocabulary,
  which is the one thing it may never do (ADR-005). So a day names an *English*
  gloss to go looking for, `lib/progress/wordOfDay.ts` asks the dictionary which
  Estonian word carries that gloss, and the Estonian on the screen is whatever
  Ekilex and Wiktionary already agreed on. The English gloss is the only
  authored column in the whole pipeline, which is exactly the latitude the
  syllabus already takes.

  A gloss here is a REQUEST, not a promise. A deployment's dictionary decides
  whether it can be met, and a word the learner has already met is skipped, so
  every layer offers several and there are always more layers underneath. The
  card only ever names the occasion that actually produced the word on it: if
  the dictionary cannot answer for Pancake Day the card does not mention
  pancakes, it says what it is instead. A reason nobody can check is worse than
  no reason.

  THE LAYERS, BEST FIRST.

    1. A day with a name. Estonia's own calendar first, because this is an app
       for people learning Estonian, mostly while living here.
    2. A day that moves, worked out from Easter. Pancake Day is the reason this
       arithmetic exists.
    3. The shape of the number. The twelfth is a dozen, the seventh is a week,
       the fifth is a hand.
    4. The weekday, where Estonian has something to say about it. Four of the
       seven are counted, and what is worth saying about the other three is
       different for each of them.
    5. The month, which always answers. This is the floor: every day of the
       year reaches it, so nothing can fall through to nothing.

  Layers three and four are deliberately full of holes. Forcing a reason onto
  the ninth of the month would mean writing one that is not true, and a page
  that tells you something charming every single day has taught you to skim it
  by the end of the first week.

  A CHARMING NOTE THAT IS WRONG COSTS MORE THAN A DULL ONE THAT IS RIGHT, AND
  THE FIRST ONE TO SHIP WAS ABOUT SATURDAY. The card printed the word for a
  sauna under a sentence saying the Estonian name for Saturday means bath day.
  That is true of the Old Norse the name was borrowed from and it is not true
  of the Estonian, where no part of the day's name says anything of the sort,
  and the one reader who can see it is the learner the card is for: somebody a
  fortnight into a course who has just learned the seven weekdays. The little
  connection is the whole reason this panel exists, so the standard has to be
  the same standard the rest of the app holds to about Estonian rather than a
  softer one for the copy round the edges.

  So, three rules for a note, each of them a way the Saturday one went wrong.

  A NOTE IS ABOUT THE DAY, NEVER ABOUT THE WORD BESIDE IT. Which of an
  occasion's glosses the dictionary answers with is the dictionary's choice and
  can differ between two deployments, so a note that explains the word on the
  card is making a promise this file cannot keep. Say what today is and let the
  word arrive next to it.

  NO NOTE SAYS THAT AN ESTONIAN NAME MEANS SOMETHING. "Means" is the word that
  did the damage, because to a learner it says the letters in front of them
  carry that sense, and half the names worth writing about here are loans where
  they do not. What may be said instead is what a name is BUILT OUT OF, which a
  learner can see for themselves in the spelling (Sunday is built out of the
  word for holy, and it is), or where a name was BORROWED FROM, naming the
  language it came from, which is a claim about history rather than about what
  an Estonian word contains. This file holds no Estonian and reads no
  dictionary, so it has nothing to check a meaning against; `wordOfDay.ts` is
  the half with Ekilex and Wiktionary behind it. Asserted in `almanac.test.ts`,
  on the sentence that shipped.

  A CLAIM WITH A NUMBER IN IT IS CHECKED BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN. The same pass
  found World Animal Day saying there were more elk here than people in Tartu,
  which is out by a factor of nine (about eleven thousand elk against ninety
  odd thousand people), and World Book Day resting on a books-per-head ranking
  the sources disagree about. Both say something true about the same day now.
  Prefer a fact that is hard to be wrong about to one that is impressive.

  Pure: a day key in, English out. No React, no Prisma, no clock of its own.
