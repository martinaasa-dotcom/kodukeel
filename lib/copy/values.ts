 * generated, so the app now strips it out of Anu's prose and forbids it in
 * hand-written copy. A nil marker that is the one banned character is a
 * marker nobody can reason about.
 *
 * A BARE HYPHEN WAS THE OBVIOUS SWAP AND IS WRONG. These sit in a table of
 * forms, in a column of them, beside percentages: a lone `-` in a grid of
 * Estonian forms reads as a form that is one character long, and beside
 * `62%` it reads as a minus sign whose digits failed to load. `n/a` cannot
 * be misread as either, and it is what a person would actually write in a
 * table by hand.
 *
 * ONE CONSTANT, so it is one edit if that call ever changes, and so a test
 * can assert on the constant rather than on a string somebody retyped.

 * `august` is `August`, `november` is `November`, and the capital letter is
 * the lesson: Estonian writes its months in lower case and English does not.
 * Folding case would delete the one thing those five cards teach.
 *
 * The sentence says "spelled" rather than "the same word" because it is not
 * said the same: `sport` and `stress` are Estonian words with Estonian
 * quantity and an Estonian vowel in them, and the audio beside it is the point.
