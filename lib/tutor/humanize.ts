  ANU'S PROSE, AFTER THE MODEL AND BEFORE THE LEARNER.

  Two rules the app states and the model only mostly follows.

  The first is punctuation. A dash used as a clause break is the loudest
  single tell that a sentence was generated rather than written, and this
  app's whole voice is a teacher explaining something to one person. The
  system prompt asks for none; a prompt is a request, and this is the pass
  that makes it true.

  The second is the stock opener. "It's important to note that" and "at the
  end of the day" carry no information at all, and a learner reading an
  explanation of the partitive should not have to walk past one to reach it.

  NEITHER LIST LIVES HERE ANY MORE. `lib/copy/voice.ts` is the one table of
  what gives a sentence away, and this file is the pass that applies the part
  of it a stream can safely apply. It used to hold its own copy, `prompt.ts`
  asked the model in different words again, and `readerCopy.test.ts` swept
  hand-written copy for a third list, so a phrase banned in Anu's answer was
  fine in the panel beside it and nobody could see that from any one file.

  WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOUCHED, AND WHY THAT IS THE WHOLE CARE HERE.

  Estonian. Never a word of it. Two lines in a reply are Estonian by
  construction, the `FIX:` line carrying a corrected sentence and every
  `VOCAB:` line, and both are passed through byte for byte. Rewriting
  punctuation inside a corrected sentence would change what Anu said the
  correction was, which is the one thing in this conversation a learner is
  meant to be able to trust, and a `VOCAB:` line is parsed on its pipe by
  `splitVocab` before it can become a flashcard. Anything this pass did to
  either would be the app editing Estonian, which is the rule the whole
  project is built around (ADR-005).

  Estonian quoted inside a paragraph is a different case and is safe: a
  paragraph rewrite only ever changes dash punctuation and drops an English
  opener, and neither can reach inside a word.

  A CASE NAME ONE OR TWO LETTERS OFF THE TABLE'S IS THE TABLE'S.

  `alalaleütlev` reached a learner, from the cheapest model that otherwise
  teaches well, and it is not a word: the case is the alaleütlev and the
  model doubled a syllable on its way to it. A case name is metalanguage
  rather than a form somebody memorises, the fourteen of them are the
  table in `lib/estonian/cases.ts`, and a misspelling of one is a typo of a
  term this app owns, so it is put right on the way past, which is a
  different thing from editing a form the learner is going to learn: no
  FIX: or VOCAB: line is touched, and a word that is not within two letters
  of exactly one name is left exactly as it came. Two letters, because the

  THE SAME PASS, OVER A REPLY THAT HAS NOT FINISHED ARRIVING.

  Anu streams, and a learner watching words appear is most of why the tutor
  feels like a person rather than a form submission. So this cannot simply
  buffer the whole answer and clean it at the end.

  It cannot naively clean each chunk either, because every rule here reads
  ahead. A chunk ending on a dash does not yet know whether the dash closes
  an aside, opens a sentence, or is just a comma, and a chunk carrying the
  first three words of a line does not yet know whether they are the start of
  a stock opener.

  So text is held back only where a rule could still change it, and released
  everywhere else. In ordinary prose, which is nearly all of it, nothing is
  held beyond the word currently being typed.

  THE STATE IS THE PART THAT MATTERS, AND IT IS WHAT THE FIRST VERSION GOT
  WRONG. Deciding "is this an Estonian line" by looking at the tail of the
  buffer works exactly until the first half of that line has already been
  shown, because what is left in the buffer no longer starts with `FIX:` and
  reads as ordinary prose. Measured on the test below: `FIX: Ma loen
  raamatut — see on huvitav.` came out of the stream as `FIX: Ma loen
  raamatut, see on huvitav.`, which is the app editing a corrected Estonian
  sentence, one chunk boundary at a time. So the answer is decided once, when
  a line opens, and carried until that line ends.
