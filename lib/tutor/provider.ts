      THE LAST RESORT, AND THE THING THAT MAKES IT SAFE TO HAVE ONE.

      A purpose whose own provider is having a bad hour used to have nowhere to
      go, which was deliberate: the note above says a Groq outage routed to
      Anthropic would drain the balance Anu depends on, so one provider's bad
      hour would take down the feature with no fallback at all.

      That argument was about an *ungated* fallback. What makes this safe is
      `allowFallback`, which the ledger sets false the moment the day's
      dedicated fallback budget is spent: the fallback is bounded, small, and
      separate from every per-kind slice, so the worst a total Groq outage can
      cost the Anthropic balance is that one number. Past it the chain is the
      purpose's own provider again, that provider is down, and the purpose
      degrades exactly as it did before this existed — a scene off its
      recorded and banked lines, which is how a keyless deployment plays all
      fourteen of them.

      Anu is the exception and takes no fallback at all. Her provider *is*
      Anthropic, so there is nothing behind it but Groq, and `npm run
      eval:anu` measured what Groq does with her questions: it called the
      tuba : toa gradation "b becomes v" where the dictionary says b : ∅,
      offered "Mul meeldib" for "Mulle meeldib", and invented `lähema` for
      `minema` and `kotta` for `koju`, emitting the first as a VOCAB line the
      app parses. A fallback that answers wrongly is worse than one that does
      not answer, because the learner cannot tell.

    GROQ LEADS, AND THE POLICY THIS REPLACED WAS "FREE FIRST".

    That rule was written when the only way to run this app without a card was
    OpenRouter's free models, so the order encoded "everything a stranger can
    set up for nothing is tried before anything that bills". It is still the
    right instinct for an install with a free key and no budget, and it is no
    longer the right *default*, for a reason the price table now makes plain:
    Groq's rate is $0.29 and $0.59 per MTok, which is a fortieth of what the
    dearest link in this chain charges and close enough to nothing that
    preferring a rate-limited free model over it buys a 429 to save a
    hundredth of a cent. A free model is limited hard upstream by design, so
    "free first" spends the learner's wait rather than the operator's money.

    So the ordering rule is now: the measured, cheap, reliable provider first,
    then whatever free tiers an install has, then the dear ones. `worthFalling
    BackFrom` is untouched, so a throttled Groq still walks to whatever is
    behind it.

    THIS IS THE GENERAL CHAIN ONLY. Anu and scene composition do not read it
    (see `PURPOSE_CHAINS`); what it serves is the writing grader, the
    dictionary's translation and the page scanner. On an install carrying only
    the two keys this app is now run with, it is Groq then Anthropic, which is
    exactly the ranking above and was already the ranking before this moved.
    What the move changes is that it stays the ranking on an install that also
    has a free key, rather than depending on which keys happen to be set.
