 * is the fallback rather than the default.
 *
 * WHICH ONE ANSWERED IS THEN A FACT ABOUT THE ANSWER, and the app says so.
 * `streamReply` reports the provider that actually served the stream, never
 * the head of the chain, because a screen naming the wrong model is worse

/**
 * The headers every Anthropic call sends, and the one that is not optional for
 * half of the keys people actually have.
 *
 * An Anthropic key is scoped either to a workspace or to the organization. A
 * workspace key needs nothing beyond the two headers this always sent; an
 * org-scoped key is refused outright without `anthropic-workspace-id`, with a
 * 400 whose message names the header. So the app worked with one shape of key
 * and could not make a single call with the other, on any path: the tutor, the
 * scanner and the grader all built these headers separately and all three sent
 * the same two.
 *
 * WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE RATHER THAN WHAT IT WAS. `assertOk` has no branch for a
 * 400, so it becomes a `TutorError` at 502, which `worthFallingBackFrom` treats
 * as worth trying the next provider for. So nothing broke loudly: on a chain
 * with a free provider in front, Anthropic simply never answered and the
 * fallback leg was dead with nothing on any screen to say so; on a deployment
 * where Anthropic is the only key, every AI feature degraded to its no-key
 * state while a key sat correctly configured in the environment.
 *
 * Sent only when set, because a workspace-scoped key must not carry it: the
 * header names a workspace the key may not be in, and Anthropic refuses that
 * too. Absent is the ordinary case and the one that behaves exactly as before.
