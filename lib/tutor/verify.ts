 * worth naming rather than implying: `isCandidateForm` only reaches a word that
 * is quoted or carries õäöüšž, and a great deal of Estonian is neither, so
 * `sa oled kodus` written straight into a sentence of prose passes untouched.
 *
 * Widening the extractor is not the obvious fix it looks like. The dictionary
 * behind this one removes a false positive only where the word happens to be an
 * Estonian lemma; an English word that is not one comes back unmatched and would
 * be flagged as an unverified Estonian form, which trains the learner to ignore
 * the line on the day it is right. So the recall stays where the precision is,
 * and the reply's Estonian claims are boxed and tagged in the UI instead.
