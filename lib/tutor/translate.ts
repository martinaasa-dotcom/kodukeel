/**
 * One short answer from whichever provider will give one.
 *
 * These two callers want a handful of words, not a conversation, so they get
 * the chain's fallback behavior and none of its streaming: a gloss that
 * arrives a word at a time is a gloss nobody watches arrive. `cap` stops a
 * model that has decided to write an essay from being read to the end.
 *
 * THE METER IS IN HERE RATHER THAN IN EACH CALLER, BECAUSE IT WAS IN NEITHER.
 * Every route that reaches a paid provider calls `authoriseCall` before and
 * `recordUsage` after, and CLAUDE.md states that as a rule with no exceptions.
 * These two functions were the exception: a dictionary search that missed
 * locally and missed on Wiktionary fired a real completion with no burst
 * limit, no daily allowance, no global budget check, and no row in the ledger
 * afterwards. Fifty pasted words was fifty unmetered calls that the Settings
 * usage meter would then report as nothing having been spent, which is the
 * one failure mode a cap must not have: quietly measuring less than was spent.
 *
 * Putting it in `ask` rather than in the two callers is deliberate. The next
 * short helper that wants a sentence out of a model will be written by
 * reaching for this function, and it inherits the meter by doing so.
 *
 * `GRADER` is the right kind: a few hundred tokens about one word, capped
 * below at 200 or 400 characters of reply, which is what that allowance was
 * sized for. It is not a new tier, because a new tier is a new number nobody
 * has a reason for.
