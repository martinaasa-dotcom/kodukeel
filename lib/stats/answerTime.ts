/**
 * HOW LONG ONE ANSWER TAKES, WHICH IS THE HALF OF LEARNING NOTHING HERE READ.
 *
 * `Review.durationMs` has been written since the scheduler was built. Every
 * timed round sends it, the offline outbox carries it, `writeGrade` bounds it,
 * and the backup includes it. `lib/stats/pace.ts` reads it as the length of a
 * sitting, for the plan, which is a fact about an evening. Nothing has read it
 * as the time on one answer, which is a fact about a word: not a chart, not
 * the scheduler, not the round that decides how hard to ask next. Two
 * quantities off one column, in two modules, so neither carries the other's
 * floor.
 *
 * The question it answers is the one a deck of flashcards cannot: **the
 * difference between knowing a form and being able to reach for it.** Accuracy
 * says a learner gets the seesütlev right nine times in ten. It cannot say
 * whether that takes them half a second or eight, and those are two different
 * states: one is a word they have, the other is a rule they are applying. A
 * conversation only gives you the first.
 *
 * THREE RULES DECIDE WHICH ROWS COUNT, AND EACH IS A WAY THE NUMBER WOULD
 * OTHERWISE BE ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
 *
 * **Only answers a round timed.** Zero is not a fast answer, it is a round
 * that never started a clock, and that is most of them: Sõnad, the crossword,
 * picture match, minimal pairs, the government drill and the paste-your-own
 * round all grade in bulk and write zero. Match used to divide its round clock
 * by the number of pairs, which is worse than zero because it survives a
 * `> 0` filter while measuring nothing; it writes zero now, for that reason.
 *
 * **Only answers that were recalled.** Time on a wrong answer measures how
 * long somebody stared at something they did not know, and that is dominated
 * by whether they gave up or kept trying, which is temperament rather than
 * memory. Retrieval speed is a fact about successful retrieval.
 *
 * **The median, never the mean.** `writeGrade` caps the column at ten
 * minutes, so a tab left open at lunch writes exactly 600,000 and the value is
 * a ceiling rather than a measurement. One of those moves a mean over twenty
 * answers by half a minute and moves a median not at all.
 *
 * A fourth shape is why `forms` defaults to true below. On a self-graded flip
 * card the duration runs until the learner presses a rating, so it includes
 * reading the answer and deciding what to call it, which is the reason
 * `docs/19-research-export.md` keeps the column out of the research file. A
 * case or a verb form is typed and marked, so its clock stops at the answer.
 *
 * AND THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST THE LEARNER'S OWN PACE, NEVER A NUMBER OF
 * OURS. Modes ask for different amounts of typing: producing `toas` and
 * writing a sentence around it are not the same keystrokes, so an absolute
 * threshold in milliseconds would name the typing rather than the recall, and
 * would be a different threshold on a phone. A slot is slow when it is slow
 * *for this learner*, against their own median across everything they were
 * timed on.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock. The rows come from the page.
