/**
 * Turning the review log into the pictures a learner (or a teacher) can act on.

 * keeps the interesting logic (day boundaries, empty ranges, off-by-one at the
 * edges of a heatmap) unit-testable without a database.
 *
 * All bucketing uses the learner's own calendar day, which means every
 * function here takes a `DayClock`. It is not a decoration: these run on the
 * server, and a server's midnight is the deployment's rather than the
 * learner's, so a heatmap built without one draws somebody's evening on the
