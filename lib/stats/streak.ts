 * The streak: consecutive days with a review behind them, and the shields that

 * It lived in `lib/achievements/badges.ts` and outlived it. The badges and the
 * XP levels they were weighed in were withdrawn while the app's own content is
 * being got right; the streak was never part of that. It is the one figure on
 * Today that answers "did I turn up", it is what the week strip is drawn from,
 * and a shield is a row somebody has already banked.
 *
 * Pure, framework-free, and it takes its clock rather than reading one: a
 * streak that breaks at the wrong midnight is worse than no streak at all.
 * Anything running on a server passes the learner's own, because the default
 * reads whichever zone the process happens to sit in. See lib/time/day.ts.

 * and the streak ends there, because a shield that does not keep the streak
 * alive has bought the learner nothing.
 *
 * `previouslyShieldedDates` are days a shield has already covered on an
 * earlier call; they count toward the streak like a real review and never
 * spend another shield. The walk back through history stops at the earliest
 * date `reviewDates` or `previouslyShieldedDates` actually knows about —
 * without that bound, an idle account with shields banked would have them

      The whole gap is measured before any of it is paid for. Spending shields
      one missed day at a time bridged the nearest days of a gap too wide to
      cross, broke on the next, and left the learner with neither the run nor
      the shields, while the covered days went on record for the shield letter
      to announce. A gap the shields in stock cannot cover whole is left alone
      and the shields stay banked for one they can. The walk only ever reaches
      a missed day above the earliest known one, so every gap it measures ends
      on a day somebody studied or a shield already covered.
