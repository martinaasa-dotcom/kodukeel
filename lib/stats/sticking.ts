/**
 * The cards that are fighting you.
 *
 * Every spaced-repetition deck grows a handful of cards that never stick: you
 * learn them, forget them, learn them again, forget them again. Anki calls them
 * leeches and its answer is to suspend them after eight lapses. That is the
 * right instinct and the wrong number for a language course — by the eighth
 * lapse the learner has spent twenty minutes on one word and drawn the
 * conclusion that they are bad at Estonian.
 *
 * So this names them earlier, and names *why*: a card that keeps lapsing after
 * being learned is usually not a memory problem, it is a grammar problem. The
 * word is fine and the case is not, or the English gloss is doing two jobs. The
 * view that renders this offers the explanation and the dictionary entry before
 * it offers the suspend button.
 *
 * Derived, never stored (ADR-014): lapses come off the card's own FSRS state
 * and accuracy off the append-only review log, so nothing here can drift and
 * nothing needs backfilling when the rule changes.
