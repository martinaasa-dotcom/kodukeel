/**
 * HOW MUCH OF THIS APP A LEARNER ACTUALLY DOES, READ OFF THE LOG.
 *
 * The plan asked "days a week you will really practice" and built a year on
 * the answer, and the answer is a hope. Every grade a learner gives is written
 * down with the moment it landed and how long the card was on screen, so once
 * there is a fortnight of log the app knows the real figure and quoting the
 * hope instead is the app choosing not to look. Somebody who said five days
 * and does two is not told off for it; they are shown a plan built on two,
 * which is the one they can actually keep.
 *
 * Time is counted the way a sitting is: the run of reviews with no gap longer
 * than `SESSION_GAP_MS`, from the first card to the last plus the first card's
 * own thinking time, because the timestamp is when the grade landed and the
 * first card's minute sits before it. Reading a correction, opening the
 * grammar page it links to and coming back is inside the sitting; lunch is
 * not. Summing the card durations alone would miss all of that and call a
 * forty-minute evening twelve minutes.
 *
 * Pure, and hermetic: it takes rows and a clock and knows nothing of Prisma.
 * `lib/progress/plan.ts` is what reads the rows.
 */

/**
 * The longest pause that still counts as the same sitting.
 *
 * Ten minutes rather than five, because a learner who reads the correction on
 * a card they missed and thinks about it is still in the session, and rather
 * than thirty, because coming back after lunch is a new one.
 * `lib/progress/impact.ts` reads the same figure for the funder's report,
 * since a sitting cannot be one length for a plan and another for a report.
