/**
 * THE SENTENCE A WORD IS TAUGHT WITH, WITH A DICTIONARY UNDER EVERY OTHER WORD
 * IN IT.
 *
 * A first meeting shows the word doing its job in a sentence a lexicographer
 * recorded, which is the whole claim of that screen, and for most words the
 * sentence arrived with no English at all: Ekilex has none on a reader key. So
 * a beginner met `Lausa uskumatu, kui muutunud ta on!` under a word they had
 * been told the meaning of ten seconds earlier and could read one word of it.
 * The sentence was doing the opposite of its job. It was reported that way by
 * somebody using it, who asked for what Speakly does: the words around the new
 * one are underlined, and you can look at one without leaving the card.
 *
 * THE SAME GATE AS A PHOTOGRAPHED PAGE AND A HEADLINE (ADR-021). Nothing here
 * proposes a meaning: `matchEstonianForm` decides, at `VOUCHED_SCORE`, so a
 * word is offered a gloss only because the dictionary recognizes that exact
 * spelling, a stored form of an entry, or a regular case of its genitive stem.
 * What is shown is the dictionary's own headword and the dictionary's own
 * English, never a reading of this sentence: `kohvi` opens as `kohv, coffee`
 * and says which form it recognized. A word it will not vouch for is printed
 * plain, exactly as a headline's names are, because leaving it out would be
 * editing an attested sentence and guessing at it would be worse.
 *
 * Nothing is written, nothing is generated and nothing is stored. Every
 * English string in here is a gloss already sitting in `Lexeme.translation`,
 * and the Estonian is the sentence as it was recorded (ADR-005).
 *
 * Server only: it reads Prisma. `glossTokens` is the pure half, so what a
 * screen draws can be tested over fixtures without one.
