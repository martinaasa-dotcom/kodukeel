/**
 * The gate between a photograph and the deck.
 *
 * `lib/scan/extract.ts` produces candidates: strings a model claims are
 * printed on a page. This is where the app decides whether it believes any of
 * them, and the answer is only ever "the dictionary recognizes this exact
 * spelling, one of its stored forms, or a regular case built on its stem".
 * Nothing looser, because a fuzzy match would silently hand somebody a
 * flashcard for a word that is not the one on their paper, and the scheduler
 * would then spend six weeks drilling it in.
 *
 * A HOMEWORK PAGE IS FULL OF INFLECTED FORMS, which is exactly what makes this
 * worth doing rather than a plain string equality. A textbook exercise says
 * `toas` and `lugesin`, not `tuba` and `lugema`, and the inflected-form search
 * this app already had (`matchEstonianForm`) resolves both and says which case
 * or person it recognized. So the photograph of an exercise becomes a set of
 * headwords with real forms behind them, and the learner is told, per word,
 * what they were actually looking at.

/**
 * Narrowing the dictionary to the rows a page could possibly match.
 *
 * THIS PULLED THE WHOLE TABLE WITH `take: 4000` AND NO ORDERING, WHICH IS THE
 * FAULT `searchLexemes` HAD JUST BEEN FIXED FOR AND ITS COMMENT DESCRIBES IN
 * FULL. It was true that "a few thousand rows is milliseconds" when the
 * dictionary was 370 hand-written words. The expanded dictionary is 5,400, so
 * the cap was below the table: Postgres returns rows in no defined order
 * without an ORDER BY, so roughly a quarter of the dictionary was invisible to
 * the scanner, and *which* quarter changed between requests. A learner
 * photographing homework got words back unvouched that the dictionary holds,
 * differently each time. `resolveScan.itest.ts` caught it as a test that
 * failed three times and then passed, on unchanged code.
 *
 * So the database narrows and `matchEstonianForm` still decides, exactly as
 * `searchLexemes` does. The predicate is a deliberate superset of what that
 * matcher accepts: it scores a lemma, a stored form, or a regular case of the
 * genitive stem at or above `VOUCHED_SCORE`, and rejects the English-only tier
 * outright, so there is no English branch here. `possibleStems` is imported
 * rather than restated, because the suffix list has to stay the one the ranker
 * scores with or the prefilter can drop a form the matcher would have taken.
 *
 * One query for the page, still: a page can carry sixty words and sixty
 * queries was the thing the original was right to avoid.
