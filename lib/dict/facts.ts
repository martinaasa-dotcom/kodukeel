/**
 * FACTS ABOUT THE SHARED DICTIONARY, READ ONCE RATHER THAN ONCE PER LEARNER.
 *
 * `Lexeme` and `Form` are reference data every learner sees (ADR-012), so a
 * query with no `ownerId` in it is asking a question whose answer is the same
 * for everybody and the same on the next request. Three of them were on the
 * render path of Today, which is the page somebody opens every morning:
 *
 *   - which of the course's 1,473 lemmas the dictionary actually holds
 *     (`pathWithProgress`, and it ran three times in one render);
 *   - how many entries there are per CEFR band;
 *   - every lemma in the dictionary with its band, which at the shipped size
 *     is 5,959 rows, fetched in full, to count how many of them the learner
 *     already knows.
 *
 * None of that is a fact about the person waiting for the page. Measured
 * against a socket on the same machine the last one alone was 49ms; against a
 * hosted Postgres it is that plus a round trip plus the rows on the wire, and
 * it was being paid by every learner on every load of the busiest screen here.
 *
 * WHY A TTL AND NOT AN INVALIDATION.
 *
 * The dictionary has half a dozen write paths: a hand edit, an accepted
 * suggestion, a word confirmed off a photograph, a pasted list, a live Ekilex
 * lookup writing what it found. A cache cleared from each of them is a cache
 * that goes stale the first time somebody adds a seventh and does not know to,
 * and that failure is silent and permanent. A minute is self-healing, needs no
 * call sites to stay in step, and is measured against what it costs: a word
 * added by hand is counted toward a readiness percentage, and toward which
 * of a unit's words the dictionary can show, up to sixty seconds later than it
 * used to be. Nothing a reader could notice, and nothing that decides anything.
 *
 * Per warm instance, like `lib/cache/singleFlight.ts` and the rate limiter, and
 * for the reason that module gives about itself: it costs no infrastructure and
 * it removes the load that actually happens. `singleFlight` is what stops a
 * class of twenty-five arriving together from making twenty-five copies of the
 * same query while the first one is still in the air.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MAY HOLD. Only things that are true of the dictionary rather than
 * of a learner. Nothing keyed on an `ownerId` may be cached here: it would be
 * one person's deck served to the next person through the same door.
