  A VERB NO DICTIONARY HOLDS, BECAUSE THE REAL ONES ARE NOT A FIXED FIXTURE.

  `helistab` is a stored form the moment Ekilex enriches `helistama`, which any
  earlier suite can cause by opening the entry, so a check on a real word
  passes through the stored-form branch on one machine and through the derived
  one on another. This verb has a first person and nothing else, so only the
  rule can reach its other persons.

  Spelled so nobody could mistake it for Estonian: this app writes none
  (ADR-005) and neither do its fixtures.
