/**
 * IS THAT AN ESTONIAN WORD?
 *
 * The question the dictionary could not answer. It held 5,363 entries, and
 * anything else came back as nothing at all: the same blank screen for a
 * misspelling, for an English word, and for a perfectly ordinary Estonian word
 * the seed happened not to carry. A learner reported the third case and it is
 * the one that stings, because the app had told them the word elsewhere on the
 * same site.
 *
 * `KnownWord` is 154,995 headwords built in thirty-two requests
 * (`scripts/build-wordlist.ts`) and it knows only that they exist; the forms
 * list beside it (`lib/dict/forms.ts`) knows every spelling of every one of
 * them and which headword each belongs to. Between them they tell those three
 * cases apart, which is the whole of what this module is for:
 *
 *   - **A real word the dictionary lacks.** Say so, and fetch it. The live
 *     lookup already existed and already worked; nothing told the screen it was
 *     worth waiting for, so a miss looked like a dead end either way.
 *   - **A near miss.** Offer the spelling. `uudishmulik` is one letter from a
 *     word, and "no results" is a poor answer to a typo.
 *   - **Neither.** Then it really is nothing, and saying so quickly is better
 *     than two requests to a free academic service on the way to the same
 *     answer.
 *
 * Folded on both sides, so a learner who cannot type õ is still told their
 * word exists. The spelling suggestion stays over the headwords, because a
 * suggestion is a link to an entry and a headword is what an entry is called.

 * in `didYouMean` is what keeps the draw small. The cap sits above the largest
 * window the built word list has, measured at 4,227 rows (`ka` at ten letters,
 * give or take two), so it bounds the read without ever deciding which words
 * are suggestible. It was 800 over the whole prefix, and that cap did decide:
 * see `didYouMean`. Ordered, because it is a `take`.

/**
 * Whether the spelling is an Estonian word at all, and which headwords it is

 *
 * Over the forms list rather than `KnownWord`, because the question arrives
 * in a form: somebody who met `põhjas` on a sign types `põhjas`, and a list of
 * headwords says no to the seesütlev of one of the commonest nouns in the
 * language. The headwords lead where the spelling is one, so `põhi` answers
 * with `põhi` and `põhjas` answers with `põhi` and `põhjama`, which is what the
 * screen and the live lookup both need: the entry to open, or to fetch.

/**
 * Words close enough to what was typed to be worth offering.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT CATCH is a typo in the first two letters, and that is the
 * price of the prefix index: candidates are drawn by prefix, so `tuba` typed
 * as `guba` finds nothing. Widening to a trigram search would catch it and
 * would also read the whole table on a deployment where `pg_trgm` is missing,
 * which `prisma/indexes.ts` already warns is possible. A typo is nearly always
 * later in the word than the second character, and an answer that is fast and
 * usually right beats one that is thorough and sometimes very slow.
 *
 * SHORTEST FIRST, BECAUSE THE CAP CUTS AN ALPHABET IN HALF. Ordered by lemma,
 * the cap took the alphabetically first `CANDIDATES` words with the prefix,
 * and 54 of the 373 two-letter prefixes hold more than that: measured over the
 * 154,995-row word list, 77,402 words, essentially half of it, could never be
 * offered. The alphabetical head of a big prefix is long rare compounds, so
 * what it discarded was exactly what a beginner mistypes: `ka` cut at
 * `kaelarätik`, so `kana`, `kartul` and `kass` were unreachable; `ko` cut at
 * `kohevus`, so `kohv` and `kool` were; `va` cut at
 * `vahelduvvooluampermeeter`, so `vana` was. That is the `aberratsioon` fault
 * on the screen whose whole purpose is not being a dead end. Length is the
 * honest key: a suggestion is ranked by edit distance from a query of the
 * length somebody typed, so a shorter candidate is the likelier correction and
 * a 24-letter compound never was one. The lemma still ends the order, so the
 * cut is stable rather than the plan's choice.
 *
 * AND SHORTEST FIRST MOVED THE HOLE RATHER THAN CLOSING IT. The cap still cut
 * each big prefix in half, only at the other end: `raamatukogu` is 1,751st of
 * the 3,111 `ra` headwords by length and `kartulisalat` 5,107th of the 6,947
 * `ka` ones, so `raamatukgu` and `kartulisalt` came back with nothing, and the
 * same 77,402 words could never be offered, now the long ones. What makes a
 * candidate worth ranking is its length *relative to the query*, since
 * `nearest` throws away anything more than `MAX_DISTANCE` letters longer or
 * shorter before it measures a thing. So the draw is that window, nearest
 * length first, and the cap sits above the largest window there is.
 *
 * And the folding table is `lib/estonian/fold.ts`'s, not a fourth copy of the
 * six letters: that module exists because a marker and a search box that
 * disagreed about `ž` would mark somebody wrong for a spelling the dictionary
 * had just offered them.
