/**
 * That the dictionary asks Ekilex once rather than on every render.
 *
 * Two faults, both invisible in a unit test and both costing a free academic
 * service rather than showing up as a wrong answer on screen:
 *
 *   1. A word Ekilex has nothing for was never written down as a miss, so it
 *      was re-asked, twice over, on every single render of the page it
 *      appeared on. For ever. This is the same bug that cost four fifths of
 *      the dictionary on the seed's first run, in the live path.
 *   2. Two renders of the same entry arriving together made two full upgrades,
 *      which is four Ekilex requests and two `deleteMany`/`createMany` pairs
 *      racing over one word's forms.
 *
 * It needs a database because the miss is a column, and the whole point is
 * that it survives the request that recorded it.
 *
 *   npm run test:db
