/**
 * IS THAT SPELLING AN ESTONIAN WORD, AND WHICH WORD IS IT A FORM OF?
 *
 * `KnownWord` answers "is that a word" for 155,000 headwords, and a learner
 * meets the language in its forms: `põhjas` went into Sõnad, is the seesütlev
 * of `põhi`, and was refused as not a word. This is the forms list
 * `scripts/build-forms.ts` writes, 5.8 million spellings from every source
 * that may legitimately be used, and it answers two things and no more:
 * whether a spelling is Estonian, and which headwords it belongs to.
 *
 * IT IS AN ACCEPT LIST AND NOT A DICTIONARY, which is what keeps it inside
 * ADR-005. It holds no gloss, no level, no case label and no sentence, so
 * nothing read from it can become a card, a paper, a marking target or a
 * scanned word the app vouches for; `lib/srs`, `lib/exam`, `lib/assessment`
 * and `lib/dict/resolveScan.ts` may not import it, asserted. A synthesised
 * form on this side costs a non-word being let through on a word game. The
 * same form on the answer side would be drilled, and that is the difference
 * between the two sides.
 *
 * FILES RATHER THAN A TABLE, and one file per lookup. The 6,044,103 pairs in
 * Postgres with the index the search would need measured 789 MB, against 15 MB
 * as gzipped shards, for a question whose answer never changes. So a lookup
 * reads one shard keyed on the form's folded first three letters, indexes it by
 * folded spelling on the way in, and keeps it for a while, so a class typing
 * into the same corner of the alphabet reads it once. Folded on both sides,
 * as the headword list was, because a learner with no õ key is still
 * asking whether their word exists.
 *
 * No Prisma, deliberately: this module reads the filesystem and nothing else,
 * and the pure half (`formsLayout.ts`, `parseShard`) is unit tested.
