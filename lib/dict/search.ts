 * Which of two entries for the *same word* the app should lead with.

 * More than one row can hold one lemma, and that is on purpose: `@@unique` is

 * is that nothing chose between them. The scores are equal, the old tiebreak
 * compared `lemma` against `lemma` and got 0, neither query behind the search
 * carries an `ORDER BY`, and the entry page renders `hits[0]` and nothing else.
 * The winner was whatever order Postgres returned, which is stable enough to
 * look decided and arbitrary enough to change under a reindex or a restore.
 *
 * Two things went wrong with that. A fresh seed shipped thirteen lemmas holding
 * two rows each, the A1 and A2 adjectives of open question Q8 where the course
 * harvest said ADJECTIVE and the built expansion said NOUN; Q8 has since been
 * answered and the builder reads the part of speech off the sense the gloss
 * came from, which takes that to **two**, `hall` and `rõõmus`. And a learner
 * who confirms a scanned word the dictionary already knows gets a second,
 * formless row that could shadow the real one, so the paradigm disappeared
 * from the entry page for a word the app knows perfectly well. That second one
 * is the case this function cannot be relieved of: any learner can make one in
 * a minute, for any word, and no upstream correction reaches it.
 *
 * So: an entry there is something to teach from wins. A known part of speech
 * beats OTHER, which is what an unvouched scanned word is filed as. Then a
 * hand-written entry beats a built one. Then more stored principal parts beats
 * fewer. `id` last makes the order *total*, which is the property that actually
 * matters — a comparator that can return 0 for two different rows leaves the
 * answer to the array it was handed.
 *
 * WRITTEN BY HAND BEFORE COUNTED, AND THE ORDER OF THOSE TWO IS THE POINT.
 *
 * Ranking on the number of stored forms alone got this backwards on the pairs
 * it was written for. Measured when there were thirteen of them: `vana` had a
 * hand-checked A1 adjective from the course with five principal parts, and a
 * noun from the built expansion with six, glossed "an old person; guy, dude,
 * chap". So a learner searching the commonest adjective in the language was
 * handed the noun, every time and by rule, which is worse than the arbitrary
 * answer it replaced. The part-of-speech fix has since made `vana` one entry;
 * `hall` is the same shape and still two, the course teaching gray and the
 * expansion holding frost, and a confirmed scan is the same shape again with
 * no forms at all.
 *
 * `prisma/expanded.ts` already states the precedence this restores: the
 * expansion loads with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and never an update, "so a
 * hand-written entry, a learner's correction and a live Ekilex fetch all win
 * over it". That was a rule about writes and it is just as true about reads.
 * SEED and USER are the rows a person wrote; EKILEX is the built expansion, which is
 * every row it wrote and is where a wrong part of speech comes from in the
 * first place.
 *
 * It sits *after* the OTHER test on purpose. An unvouched word confirmed off a
 * photograph is USER and is filed as OTHER, so putting provenance first would
 * hand a formless stub the entry page again, which is the bug this function
 * exists for.

    THE LAST TWO KEYS ARE WHAT MAKE THIS AN ORDER RATHER THAN NEARLY ONE.

    Two entries can share a lemma: `Lexeme` is unique on `[lemma, pos]` because

    learner adding `tuba` by hand or off a photograph gets their own row beside
    the seeded one. Both then score 100 for the exact lemma, and
    `localeCompare` of a word with itself is 0, so with those two keys alone
    the comparator returned 0 for the pair.

    A comparator that returns 0 does not mean "either will do". `sort` is
    stable, so it means "keep the order you were given", and the order we were
    given is whatever Postgres returned from a `findMany` with no `orderBy` —
    a fact about the plan and the physical layout of the table rather than
    about Estonian. `/dictionary` opens `hits[0]` without asking, so the entry
    a learner is shown for their own search was decided by the query planner.
    It is the fault `resolveScan.ts` has a comment about, one layer up: an
    order nobody specified is not an order.

 * model's lemma as the dictionary's own headword, and a photographed page
 * resolved to a formless row and built cards from it.
