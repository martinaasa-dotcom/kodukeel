/**
 * The dozen words the dictionary offers somebody who has not searched yet.
 *
 * THIS ROW USED TO BE `ORDER BY lemma ASC, SKIP (days % 40), TAKE 12`, which
 * is a twelve-row window inside the first forty rows of an alphabetical list.
 * The skip made it look as though it moved and it never left the letter A: for
 * the whole life of the app every learner on every day was invited to look up
 * `aasialane`, `aastatuhat`, `aatomipomm` and `aberratsioon`. Three of those
 * carry no CEFR level at all, because they arrived in the tail of the
 * Wiktionary expansion rather than out of the course, and nobody learning
 * Estonian has ever needed the word for an aberration.
 *
 * A suggestion row is the answer to "what is this dictionary for", asked by
 * somebody who has just arrived and typed nothing. So it answers with words
 * that are worth the click, and it says why it chose them.
 *
 * THREE SOURCES, ONE PER RENDER, IN A ROTATING ORDER.
 *
 *   news    Words on the front page of the news this morning, vouched for by
 *           the dictionary. The most alive of the three and the one that makes
 *           the row worth looking at twice.
 *   season  The time of year, out of the course's own units. Works with no
 *           network at all, which is what makes it the one behind news.
 *   level   Words near the level this learner placed at, drawn at random.
 *           Always available, so the row is never empty and never short.
 *
 * A source has to fill most of the row on its own or it is passed over. That
 * is the reason there is no top-up: a row labeled "In the news today" whose
 * last four words came from a random draw would be a caption that is true of
 * two thirds of what is under it, and the honest alternative costs nothing but
 * a slightly shorter row.
 *
 * TWO FILTERS APPLY TO EVERY SOURCE, and between them they are why
 * `aberratsioon` cannot come back.
 *
 * A word must carry a CEFR level. That is not a guess about difficulty, it is
 * a record that somebody put the word in the course or in the graded seed. The
 * 2,090 entries with no level are the ones no source vouched for, and they are
 * exactly the ones that made the old row embarrassing.
 *
 * A word must be a noun, a verb or an adjective. Those are the entries with a
 * table of forms behind them, and that table is what the chip opens. A
 * conjunction has principal parts nobody can name and a case table nobody can
 * build, so a chip leading to one is a chip leading to a dead end.
 *
 * AND THAT SECOND FILTER IS ABOUT THE ENTRY A LEARNER LANDS ON, not about the
 * rows. A chip links to `/dictionary?q=<lemma>` and the dictionary answers a
 * lemma with one entry; `@@unique` is on `(lemma, pos)`, so a lemma can hold
 * more than one. Filtering the rows asks whether *some* entry has a table,
 * which is a different question and the one this used to ask: `oma` is an
 * adjective in the Wiktionary expansion and the pronoun the course teaches, the
 * row offered it on the strength of the adjective, and the dictionary leads
 * with the pronoun, which has no case table. `withATable` is the gate and it is
 * applied once, to whatever a source returned.

/**
 * ONE GATE RATHER THAN THREE, and it asks the question the chip's promise is
 * about.
 *
 * Each source filters the *rows* by part of speech, which answers "does the
 * table hold an entry with this lemma that has a table". A chip links to
 * `/dictionary?q=<lemma>` and the dictionary answers a lemma with the one entry
 * `bySubstance` leads with, so wherever a lemma holds more than one those are
 * different questions. `oma` is the shipped instance: the Wiktionary expansion
 * heads it `Adjective`, the course teaches it in the pronoun unit where Ekilex
 * calls it an asesõna, the row offered it on the strength of the adjective, and
 * the dictionary leads with the pronoun, which has no case table to open.
 *
 * A lemma is kept only when *every* entry under it has a table. That is
 * stricter than asking `bySubstance` and needs neither its forms counts nor its
 * provenance: whichever entry the dictionary leads with, the chip is good. What
 * it costs is measured and is two words in the whole shipped dictionary, `oma`
 * and `või`, butter and the conjunction both, which the row would have led to
 * the noun for. Two out of six thousand, against a chip that dead-ends.
 *
 * A query rather than a read of `lib/dict/facts.ts`, which is where a fact
 * about the shared dictionary usually belongs. The lemmas asked about change
 * every render, since the front page moves and the level draw is random, so
 * there is no stable key to hold; and a word added in the last minute would be
 * offered ungated by a cache a minute old, which is the one promise this row
 * makes. It is an indexed read of a couple of hundred lemmas on a page that is
 * otherwise three queries.
 *
 * The level is deliberately not part of this. A CEFR band is a record that
 * somebody vouched for *that entry*, which the offered entry answers for
 * itself, and no lemma in the shipped dictionary holds two entries that
 * disagree about it.
 *
 * Exported so the rule can be asked directly. Driving it through `suggestWords`
 * cannot be made to fail on purpose: the level source draws twelve at random
 * out of a couple of thousand words in band, so whether a planted pair is
 * offered at all is a coin toss, and a check that passes because nothing was
 * drawn is a check nobody knows the state of. The end-to-end guard is the test
 * beside it, which asks what the dictionary shows for every word the row
 * offered, and which is what caught `oma`.
