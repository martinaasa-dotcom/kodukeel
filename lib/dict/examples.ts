 * sentence for it would be, and shortest-first was putting the compound in

 * case this file already reasons about, where a real sentence simply does
 * not carry the exact form asked for: this one is not a sentence at all, so
 * there is nothing in it to mark and nothing for `teachingSentence` to point
 * a beginner at. `sentenceWords` already splits on the same boundary a case
 * ending is matched on, so a spelling with nothing on either side of a space
