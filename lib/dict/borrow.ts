/**
 * A SENTENCE RECORDED UNDER ANOTHER WORD IS STILL A LEXICOGRAPHER'S SENTENCE.
 *
 * A case card is built out of a recorded sentence with the form taken out, and
 * for a year the only sentences a word could be built from were the handful
 * Ekilex filed under that word. `ravim` has three, none of them in a case, so a
 * learner could never be shown `ravimit` in use although `Ravimit tuleb võtta
 * kindlal nädalapäeval.` is in the dictionary, recorded under another headword.
 * The dictionary ships about twelve thousand natural sentences and each one is
 * about every word in it, not only the one it was filed under.
 *
 * So a word may borrow. This module finds, for every entry, the sentences
 * recorded under other entries that carry one of its forms, and it hands them
 * to the card builder as a second pool behind the word's own. Measured over the
 * shipped dictionary: case cards go from 996 over 914 words to 1,546 over 1,327,
 * and conjugation cards from 539 over 427 verbs to 821 over 496, with nothing
 * written and no source added. Every sentence a card is cut from is one a
 * lexicographer recorded (ADR-005).
 *
 * THE SPELLING HAS TO BELONG TO THIS WORD AND NO OTHER, and that is the whole of
 * what makes borrowing safe. A word's own usages are about the word, so a form
 * found in one is that word's form. A sentence found across the dictionary
 * makes no such promise: `Tolm ajas aevastama` carries `ajas`, which is the
 * inessive of `aeg` and the past of `ajama`, and the sentence means the
 * second. So a spelling is claimed by every entry whose forms reach it, and a
 * sentence is borrowed only for a spelling exactly one entry claims. The claim
 * index is deliberately wider than `gapForms`: the simple past is not derived
 * anywhere in this app, since `tahtsin` goes to `tahtis` and no rule gets
 * there, but the *refusal* can afford to over-reach, so a verb also claims its
 * stored first-person past with the `in` taken off. That is `ajas` for `ajama`,
 * which makes `ajas` ambiguous and keeps `Tolm ajas aevastama` off `aeg`. A
 * claim too many costs a sentence; a claim too few costs a wrong card.
 *
 * What it does not see is a homograph the dictionary does not hold at all, and
 * that is the residual: a spelling unique among six thousand entries is not
 * always unique in the language. The sentence is the second opinion in the
 * usual way, since a borrowed card is still cut by `buildCloze` and read by
 * `readCase`, and the audits that build every card the dictionary can make
 * cover the borrowed ones too.
 *
 * RANKED, because the builder takes the first sentence that fits. One with an
 * English translation first, since the reveal can print it; then shorter,
 * because a sentence about a Prussian occupation is a worse card than one
 * about a dog in a garden. Capped per word, since a common form appears in
 * hundreds of sentences and the builder needs one per case.
 *
 * Pure: entries in, a map out. No Prisma, no clock. `lib/dict/facts.ts` wraps
 * it over the deployment's own dictionary and caches the answer, and
 * `scripts/audit-questions.ts` runs it over the shipped file.
