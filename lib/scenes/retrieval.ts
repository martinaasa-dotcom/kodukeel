/**
 * Whether a sentence somebody recorded can be a line somebody says.
 *
 * This is the first rung of the ladder in `docs/21-situations.md` §2, and
 * Phase 0 exists to find out how far it reaches. Where a recorded usage fits a
 * beat, the other side's line costs a query, needs no model and needs no gate,
 * because nothing was generated. Where it does not, a model composes one inside
 * a closed word list and four checks decide whether the learner sees it. So the
 * share of beats this module can fill is the share of the feature that is free
 * and safe, and it is the number the whole design rests on.
 *
 * The funnel is five questions and they are asked in this order because each
 * one is cheaper than the next:
 *
 *   1. is it about this beat            a form of one of the beat's lemmas
 *   2. is it the right shape            a question where the move asks one
 *   3. is it a sentence somebody said   `naturalSentence`, plus a finite verb
 *   4. can the learner read it          every word inside the closed list
 *
 * There was a fifth and it was wrong. The first version filtered on the CEFR
 * band of the entry the sentence was recorded under, through `isAround`. That
 * window exists to decide which words to *teach* somebody, and it is the wrong
 * question here twice over: a band is a fact about the headword rather than
 * about the sentence filed beneath it, and a symmetric window drops a greeting
 * for being too easy, which took `Tere!` out of every B1 scene. The level
 * enters where it belongs instead, in which units the closed list is built
 * from, and readability then answers the question precisely rather than by
 * proxy: a line every one of whose words the learner has met is a line they
 * can read, whatever headword a lexicographer filed it under.
 *
 * Question three is the one that needed something new. `naturalSentence` was
 * written for the exam and rejects a usage that trails off, carries a slash or
 * labels itself; it has no opinion on `Kodune aadress.`, which is a perfectly
 * good illustration of a noun and is not a thing a receptionist says. A clause
 * needs a finite verb, and this app can list every finite verb form it knows
 * without a parser: the stored principal parts plus `derivedVerbForms`, which
 * `npm run audit:verbs` checked against Ekilex over 797 verbs. A question is
 * let through without one, because `Mis kell?` is a clause a person says and
 * has no verb in it at all.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network. Every input is data.
