/**
 * What the other side says about a question the scene did not anticipate.
 *
 * A learner told `Minge otse edasi.` who writes `okei, otse, ja kuhu siis?`
 * has asked a question the beat did not ask for, and the first version of
 * this module walked straight past it to the next move. That is the machine
 * showing through: a person caught off guard by a question still answers it,
 * as best they can from what they know, and then gets back to what they were
 * doing. This is the "as best they can", said once, and it is a ladder like
 * the one for a beat's own line, cheapest and surest first:
 *
 *   1. the beat's own answer  where the beat asked for the question, the
 *                             bank holds what they say (`answer:<beat>`),
 *                             written against the beat's own `answer` line
 *   2. how are you            `Hästi, aitäh.`, because that is the answer
 *   3. a fact off the card    "when?" gets the day and the time the run dealt
 *   4. more about it          another line for the beat they just spoke, so
 *                             "and where then?" gets the rest of the directions
 *   5. a model                one line inside the list, gated, in the route
 *   6. don't know             `Ei tea.`, which is what a stranger says
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY WRITE. Nothing. Every rung is a line the dictionary already
 * vouches for: the course's own phrases as parts (`ASIDES`), a case form off
 * `Lexicon.caseForm`, a line drafted and gated for the beat, or a line the
 * route composed and gated. The one verb form in it, `tea` after `ei`, is
 * the derived negative of `teadma` and is withheld whole where the rule
 * cannot reach it. A question this cannot answer is answered with the fifth
 * rung rather than with silence, because silence is the one thing a person
 * never does with a question.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.
