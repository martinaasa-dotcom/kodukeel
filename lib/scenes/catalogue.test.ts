/**
 * What a scene file is allowed to say.
 *
 * `docs/21-situations.md` §21 named this as invariant 1 and named it wrongly:
 * "no file under the catalog contains an Estonian letter", modeled on the
 * tripwire over `lib/estonian/grammar.ts`. Building the catalog is what
 * showed the rule was incoherent, because a scene has to name the words its
 * beats are about, and a check keyed on `õäöüšž` would allow `valu` and reject
 * `küte`, which is not a distinction about anything.
 *
 * What holds instead is stronger and is what is asserted here: every lemma a
 * scene names is a word one of its own declared units already teaches. A scene
 * cannot introduce vocabulary at all, only point at vocabulary the Ekilex
 * harvest already brought back, so a typo in this catalog fails here rather
 * than becoming a word the app believes in. That is exactly the standing
 * `lib/collections/syllabus/` has, one layer up: a lemma is a request, and
 * `syllabus.test.ts` fails when the harvest did not honor it.

    which had put them at home, answered honestly three times and was refused
    three times. There is nothing wrong with the marker in that story; the
    screen simply never told them what was wanted.

    The English gloss is what the check reads, because that is the one column
    of the harvest a person authored and it is how the word would be named to
    somebody who does not have it yet. A gloss is a list of senses and any of
    them counts: `pood` is "shop, store", and either word in the goal is the
    goal naming it.

    Deliberately not asked of a beat that would take any of several words: the
    landlord's "say what has gone wrong" accepts eleven, and naming one would
    be the fault `offerFor` already had, where a learner is told to say the
