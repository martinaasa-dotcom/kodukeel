/**
 * The three scenes Phase 1 would build, and the input Phase 0 measures.
 *
 * Every lemma below is a word one of the scene's declared units already
 * teaches, which `catalogue.test.ts` asserts word by word. That is the only
 * rule about Estonian this file has to obey and it is a strong one: a scene
 * cannot introduce vocabulary, it can only point at vocabulary the Ekilex
 * harvest brought back. Nothing here is a sentence, and no line anybody reads
 * comes from this file.
 *
 * The three are the ones `docs/21-situations.md` §19 names, chosen because the
 * course already promises all three in as many words:
 *
 *   keha-ja-tervis   "Describe a symptom to a doctor and understand the
 *                     advice you are given."
 *   eluase           "Rent a flat, describe a problem with it and deal with a
 *                     landlord."
 *   linn-ja-teenused "Deal with a bank, a post office and an official form
 *                     without switching to English."
 *
 * The shared units are the same four every time and they are the ones the
 * seventeenth pass added for the words between the words: greetings, question
 * words, pronouns, and the clock. A conversation is mostly those.
 */
import type { SaysPart, SceneSpec } from "./types";

/** Greetings, question words, pronouns, time and number. Every scene needs them. */
/*
  The units every scene declares, whatever it is about.

  The test for being here is that a unit teaches the machinery a conversation
  is made of rather than the subject of one, and four were added after
  `eval:scene` measured what leaving them out cost. Each absence was an
  oversight rather than a decision, and each was invisible until the ranked
  list of words the model reached for named it.

  `pohiverbid` teaches `olema`, and no Estonian sentence is built without the
  verb "to be". `sidesonad`, `vastused` and `maaramine` are the words between
  the words, and the two commonest things the gate withheld a line over were
  `ja` and `või`: a scene that cannot say "and" or "or" cannot say much.
  `millal` carries `praegu` and `juba`, which is how anybody says when.

  The last two arrived with the vocabulary pass and are the same argument once
  more. `kohasonad` is the postpositions, which is one of the eight units the
  seventeenth pass added for exactly this reason and the only one that was left
  out here; `alates` and `kaasas` were both in the ranked list. And
  `kus-ja-kuhu` is the adverbs of place, `siin`, `siia`, `mujal` and `asuma`,
  which stands beside `millal`'s adverbs of time for the same reason: every one
  of these scenes asks where something is before it asks anything else.

/*
  THE FIRST MISSION, AND THE DOCUMENT'S OWN EXAMPLE.

  The MVP brief argued for one screen per situation and every question tied to
  the errand, and its worked example was a trip to the shop for milk: going
  *to* it, being *in* it, coming back *from* it, which is the one word `pood`
  in the three local cases, and asking for the milk, which is the partitive. A
  learner who has those four has the half of Estonian grammar every course
  spends its first month on, met once each in the order an errand meets them.

  `sina` rather than `teie`, because the other side is a friend on the phone
  and not a counter, and that is what puts this at A1: a scene where the
  learner is never asked to manage the polite register on top of the cases.
  `kus-ja-kuhu` because the friend asks where three times, `iga-paev` because
  it teaches `tahtma`, and `sook-ja-jook` because it teaches the milk.
