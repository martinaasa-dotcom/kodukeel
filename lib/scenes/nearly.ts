/**
 * What "close enough to be understood" means, said once.
 *
 * A learner in a real conversation is understood far more often than they are
 * correct, and the gap between those two is most of what makes speaking feel
 * possible: `ma tulema koju` is not Estonian and every Estonian who hears it
 * knows the person is coming home. The first version of the marker held every
 * turn to the dictionary's exact spelling, so a dropped õ, a slipped letter, a
 * bare nominative where the sisseütlev was due, or an infinitive where a
 * person was due each read as a turn nobody could follow, and the other side
 * said "I did not catch that" to somebody who had been perfectly clear. That
 * is not how people are, and a learner who meets it three times stops
 * talking.
 *
 * So `readTurn` reads four shapes of nearly-right as the word, understood,
 * and writes down what slipped (`Slip`):
 *
 *   spelling   a diacritic folded away, or one letter out on a word of five
 *              or more; `koik` for `kõik`, `tuleen` for `tulen`
 *   case       the right word in the wrong case; `pood` where `poodi` was due
 *   form       an ending the word does not have, on a stem that is plainly
 *              its own; `haiglat` where `haiglasse` was due, and anything
 *              else built on `haigla-`
 *   person     the infinitive where a person was due; `ma tulema` for `ma tulen`
 *
 * Every one of those is decided against the dictionary and nothing else, and
 * the recast, the form the other side says back, is read off the same
 * tables every card reads: `Lexicon.caseForm` for a case and the derived
 * present for a person (ADR-005 amendment 1). Nothing here writes a form; a
 * word this module cannot recast is understood and not recast, which is what
 * a person does too.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT TOLERATED. Two letters out, because at that
 * distance `kool` is `kohv` and the marker would be guessing rather than
 * understanding; a typo on a word under five letters, for the same reason
 * (`pea`, `käsi` and `tee` are one edit from each other); and a wrong *word*,
 * which is what `offtarget` is for. A slip is a right thought in a slightly
 * wrong shape, and that is the whole of what it may be.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.

 * that ends in a form of the word, with something in front of it, is that word
 * with a modifier on the front. `piim` is not read out of `vahepiim` by
 * accident, because that is what `vahepiim` is.
 *
 * TWO GUARDS, AND BOTH ARE LOAD-BEARING. The modifier has to be long enough to
 * be a word rather than a stray letter, so `apilet` is not a ticket. And the
 * whole spelling has to be one the app can vouch for as Estonian, which is what
 * `prisma/data/forms/` answers: without it `xyzzypilet` would be a ticket, and
