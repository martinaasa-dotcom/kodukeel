/**
 * Who is behind the desk today.
 *
 * **The persona is the strongest lever in the draw and it is nearly free**
 * (`docs/19-situations.md` §5). A receptionist who wants the queue gone, one
 * who is thorough and slow, one who is new and unsure, one following a script
 * and not deviating: same beats, same props, four conversations that feel
 * nothing alike. Props change the words. An agenda changes the person.
 *
 * Three levers and each is one number or one list:
 *
 *   patience  a delta on every beat's own, so a brisk one gives you one fewer
 *             try at everything and a thorough one gives you an extra.
 *   voice     one of the ten TartuNLP voices, so a second person in a scene
 *             reads as a second person rather than as more of the first.
 *   leans     which curveballs attach to them, which is how an agenda becomes
 *             something that happens rather than a label on a card.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY WRITE. English. Not a word of Estonian, not even a lemma:
 * a persona has no vocabulary of its own, because everything they say comes
 * from the scene's own list through `sceneLine`.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no clock.
