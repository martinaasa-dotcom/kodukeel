/**
 * What a conversation is allowed to write into the review log.
 *
 * Every mode grades through `gradeCard` and a scene is no exception (ADR-016),
 * but **a conversation is a noisy instrument**, so this is deliberately
 * conservative: a row is written only where the retrieval was unambiguous. The
 * learner produced a vouched form of a word the beat actually asked for,
 * without pressing help for it, in a beat that was met.
 *
 * NEVER `Easy`, because a conversation cannot tell easy from lucky. `Good` on
 * the first attempt, `Hard` after a repair or where the word was understood
 * with a slip (`pood` for `poodi`, `tulema` for `tulen`), and `Again` where
 * the app had to supply the word. A slip is `Hard` and never `Again`, because
 * the learner *had* the word and the other side understood it, and never
 * `Good`, because the scheduler would then stretch the interval on a form
 * that has not been produced yet. Nothing about `RATINGS` or the scheduler
 * changes here; this only decides which of the four to send, which is the
 * same latitude the scene game and the crossword already take.
 *
 * WHERE THE REQUIREMENT WAS A CASE, THE ROW CARRIES IT. That is the whole
 * pedagogical point of doing this at all: **the case you fail under pressure
 * lands in the same weak-case charts as the case you fail on a card**, so the
 * partitive somebody cannot produce at a counter shows up next to the partitive
 * they cannot produce on a flashcard, and the drill they are offered is the
 * same drill.
 *
 * An abandoned scene writes nothing, exactly as an abandoned round does, which
 * falls out of this rather than being a branch: a beat nobody met is a beat
 * with nothing to grade.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no clock.
