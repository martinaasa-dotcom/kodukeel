/**
 * Why the wrong ending came out, said as the guess it is.
 *
 * The review can say which case was wanted and what that case is for. What a
 * teacher standing beside you says is the next thing: *why you reached for
 * the one you did*. That is not derivable with certainty from a transcript
 * and it is not undecidable either, which is the whole of this module: three
 * of the reasons a learner picks the wrong case leave evidence in the run,
 * and the honest thing to do with evidence that is strong and not conclusive
 * is to say so out loud rather than to say nothing.
 *
 * WHAT IS ACTUALLY DERIVABLE, and each of these is a real reason people give:
 *
 *   carried over   the case they used is the one the question before wanted.
 *                  Staying in the last answer's case is the commonest thing
 *                  that happens in a conversation, and the transcript has it.
 *   one question   the two cases answer the same question word. `kus?` is
 *                  answered by the seesütlev and the alalütlev, `kuhu?` by
 *                  the sisseütlev and the alaleütlev, and a learner who has
 *                  been taught the question has been taught both. This is
 *                  read off `CASES`, so it is a fact rather than a hunch
 *                  about the language; what is a hunch is that it is the
 *                  reason.
 *   the plain word the case they used is the nimetav, which is the word as
 *                  the dictionary lists it: the ending had not arrived.
 *   the stem       the case they used is the omastav or the osastav, the two
 *                  every other ending is built on. The stem arrived and the
 *                  ending did not.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT DO. Say any of that as a fact. A hunch carries how sure it
 * is and the copy is written as a guess in both tiers, because a wrong
 * confident diagnosis is worse than none: it teaches a learner a reason for
 * a mistake they did not make, and they have no way to tell. `sure` is the
 * same device the readiness rungs and the exam confidence use, which is that
 * a claim carries its evidence rather than being caveated in prose somewhere
 * else on the page.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY WRITE. English. Not a word of Estonian: the case names and the
 * question words are read off `CASES`, which is the one table of what a case
 * is called, and nothing here types a form or an ending. Delete every
 * Estonian word from the comments above and the output is identical, which
 * is `lib/estonian/grammar.ts`'s standing and is asserted the same way.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.
