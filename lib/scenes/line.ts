 * `docs/19-situations.md` §2. It works the way `caseAnswer` works: an attested
 * sentence ahead of a composed one ahead of the way out, **with the screen
 * saying which it got**. That last clause is the whole of ADR-025's second
 * half, and it is why the return type carries a provenance rather than a
 * string: a caller holding only the text cannot print the chip, and a chip
 * nobody printed is a composed line a learner reads as a lexicographer's.
 *
 * FOUR RUNGS, AND THE MEASURED ORDER IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. `npm run
 * measure:scenes` found that retrieval fills the moves every conversation
 * shares and almost none of the moves that make it *this* conversation,
 * because a lexicographer records a sentence to illustrate a word rather than
 * to ask a question about it. So the composer is load-bearing rather than a
 * fallback, and the gate is the thing the module rests on.
 *
 * COMPOSITION IS INJECTED. This module may not open a socket, so the caller
 * hands in a function that asks a model and this decides what to do with the
 * answer. That keeps the ladder, the retry and the fallback in one pure place
 * with unit tests around them, and puts the provider in a route where the
 * ledger can see it. It is also what lets the browser suite stub a model the
 * way `test-scan.mjs` does.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.

    THE MODEL NOW SITS ABOVE THE BANK RATHER THAN BELOW IT, AND ONLY ABOVE THE
    BANK.

    The order used to be attested, scripted, composed, on the argument that a
    line gated when it was drafted and read by a person since is worth more
    than one gated a second ago. That argument weighs the two model-written
    rungs by how much review they have had, and it is missing the thing that
    actually decides whether a line is any good here: a banked line was written
    against the beat alone, months before anybody played, and a composed line
    is written with this conversation in front of it. A receptionist who can
    answer what the learner said three turns ago is worth more than one who
    cannot, and no amount of reviewing a generic line closes that gap.

    So composition is attempted on every beat, and the bank is what catches it:
    no key, no allowance, no answer, or an answer the gate withheld, and the
    run says the drafted line instead. Every safety property is unchanged,
    because both rungs pass the same gate against the same closed word list,
    and a deployment with no key walks straight past this to the same bank line
    it says today (`compose` is absent and the rung below is reached
    unconditionally).

    THE ATTESTED RUNG KEEPS THE TOP, and that is not an exception carved out to
    avoid moving something. It is reachable only for a beat whose pool holds a
    phrase entry, which after §32 narrowed it is the courtesies: `Tere!`,
    `Aitäh!`, `Head aega!`. Those are the whole line, a lexicographer recorded
    them, and what a model does with a greeting is paraphrase a fixed phrase
    into something nobody says. Composition leads everywhere a beat has content
    to carry, which is every beat that makes a scene this scene.
