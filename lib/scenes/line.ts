/**
 * The one function that answers "what does the other side say here".
 *
 * `docs/19-situations.md` §2. It works the way `caseAnswer` works: an attested
 * sentence ahead of a composed one ahead of the way out, **with the screen
 * saying which it got**. That last clause is the whole of ADR-025's second
 * half, and it is why the return type carries a provenance rather than a
 * string: a caller holding only the text cannot print the chip, and a chip
 * nobody printed is a composed line a learner reads as a lexicographer's.
 *
 * FOUR RUNGS, AND THE MEASURED ORDER IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE. `npm run
 * measure:scenes` found that retrieval fills the moves every conversation
 * shares and almost none of the moves that make it *this* conversation,
 * because a lexicographer records a sentence to illustrate a word rather than
 * to ask a question about it. So the composer is load-bearing rather than a
 * fallback, and the gate is the thing the module rests on.
 *
 * COMPOSITION IS INJECTED. This module may not open a socket, so the caller
 * hands in a function that asks a model and this decides what to do with the
 * answer. That keeps the ladder, the retry and the fallback in one pure place
 * with unit tests around them, and puts the provider in a route where the
 * ledger can see it. It is also what lets the browser suite stub a model the
 * way `test-scan.mjs` does.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.
