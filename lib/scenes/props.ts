/**
 * The role card, which is not a decoration.
 *
 * **The learner never plays themselves** (`docs/19-situations.md` §3). They are
 * handed a card: you are a patient, your throat has hurt since Tuesday, you can
 * come any afternoon except Wednesday. Two reasons, and the second is the one
 * that matters legally.
 *
 * The first is that marking has to know what the learner is trying to say. A
 * scene that invites somebody to describe their own symptoms cannot tell a
 * complete turn from an incomplete one, because it does not know what the
 * complete one was. `{ kind: "datum" }` is decidable only because the card
 * decided the answer before the conversation started.
 *
 * The second is that a doctor scene where somebody types about their own health
 * is a database holding health data about an identified person, which is
 * Article 9 special category data, in a product whose privacy notice is one of
 * the reasons people choose it. The role card removes the question: nothing in
 * a transcript is true about the person who wrote it. **No scene asks for a
 * real document number**, and a scene that needs one supplies a fictional one,
 * because an identity code typed into a practice app is the one thing this
 * module could collect that nobody could ever take back.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY WRITE. English, and a lemma. That is the standing the
 * scene catalog already has: a lemma is a *request* against the dictionary,
 * so a misspelled one fails to arrive rather than becoming a wrong Estonian
 * word, and `catalogue.test.ts` checks every one against the units its scene
 * declares. What it may never write is a form or a sentence, which is why a
 * drawn prop carries lemmas for the caller to resolve rather than the Estonian
 * a learner would type.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no clock. The date arithmetic is over
 * plain numbers and never over `new Date()`, because a card drawn from a seed
 * has to be the same card on a reload.
 */

/**
 * One fact the card carries, before it is drawn.
 *
 * `word` is the kind that ties a card to the dictionary: the value is one of
 * the scene's own lemmas, so the Estonian the learner needs exists and the beat
 * that asks for it can be marked. The other four generate a value nobody has to
 * look up, and their accepted spellings are digits, which is how people write a
