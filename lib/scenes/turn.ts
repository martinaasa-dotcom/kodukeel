/**
 * What the dictionary found in a learner's turn, and nothing else.
 *
 * This is the half of a scene with no model in it (`docs/19-situations.md` §8),
 * and the type system is what keeps it that way: `readTurn` is the only
 * producer of `Evidence` and `advance` is its only consumer, so a caller
 * holding a model's opinion about whether somebody was understood cannot
 * satisfy the type. That is `buildOptions` taking a parsed `Government` rather
 * than a case key, pointed at a conversation.
 *
 * Every requirement is decided by a string comparison against something the
 * dictionary vouches for, assembled once into a `TurnContext` by the caller:
 * a form of a word, a case of a word through `caseAnswer`, a value off the
 * role card, a question word, the negator, a pronoun of the expected register.
 * None of that needs a network, a database or a clock.
 *
 * FIVE READINGS RATHER THAN TWO, which is most of what makes this a
 * conversation instead of a marker. "Understood, and you left out the bit I
 * asked for" is what a receptionist actually says and no drill in this app has
 * ever imitated it; "several words I know, none of them the point" is a
 * learner who said something real that the scene did not anticipate, and it
 * gets a narrower re-ask and a report button rather than "say again"; and a
 * turn written in English is recognized as English, because telling somebody
 * "I did not understand" when they wrote a clear English sentence is a lie.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.

    A GREETING CANNOT BE FAILED, AND A CLOSED LIST OF TWO WAS NEVER GOING TO

    A scene's greet beat names the greetings its units teach, which is `Tere!`
    and `Tere hommikust!`, and a scene may name nothing else (ADR-005: a lemma
    is a request against the course). Estonian has many more. A learner
    answered `Tere!` with `Tervitused!`, which is a greeting, which the
    dictionary holds, and which no unit teaches, and the app refused it. There
    is no mechanical repair for that inside the list: `tere` is glossed
    "hello" and `tervitus` "greeting, salutation", the two share not one word,
    and Ekilex's own definitions connect them only through prose. Widening the
    list by hand would refuse the next person instead.

    So the beat is met by anything they say back. The other side has just said
    hello; a person who answers at all has greeted them, and there is nothing
    left for a refusal to teach, because the word is on the screen one line
    above and `offerFor` hands it over. That covers every scene there is and
    every one nobody has written, which a longer list would not.

    NOTHING IS GRADED FOR IT. `satisfiedBy` stays empty, so no row goes into
    the review log claiming the learner produced `Tere!` when what they
    produced was something else (`gradesFor`). The beat is met, the objective
    ticks, and the append-only log says only what actually happened.

    ANYTHING THEY SAY BACK, AND NOT ANYTHING AT ALL. The first version of this
    took every turn, and an integration test caught it: a run whose only turn
    was `qqqq wwww` came back with the greeting credited. An objective the
    learner did not meet is one the debrief has to be able to say they did not
    meet, and a scene that credits one for typing is a scene with a score
    hidden inside it. So the turn has to be something the app can account for,
    which after `knowing` is the whole language rather than this scene's few
    hundred words. A greeting in English is met one rung down, by the gloss,
    since `tere` is "hello" and that is what the learner reached for.

    Only `greet`. A farewell is read against every turn of the scene, because

    A case slip says "you reached for the wrong ending", and it was claimed
    wherever the word turned up in any other form. Inside a sentence that is a
    guess about grammar this module cannot parse, and it was wrong in both
    directions on a real run: `Piim on otsas` is a correct sentence with `piim`
    as its subject, and it was answered "Understood. Here it is piima.", and
    `Ma olen ikka kodus, pood on 5 minuti kaugusel` was answered "Here it is
    poes." over a `pood` that was the subject of its own clause. Both told a
    learner their correct Estonian was wrong, in the one place this app has
    where being wrong is supposed to be survivable.

    What the position can settle is the case where the word IS the answer:
    asked `Kuhu sa lähed?` and told `pood`, or told `Ma lähen pood`, the
    ending really is missing and saying so is the one correction a
    conversation makes without stopping. So a slip is claimed where the word
    is the whole turn or the last word of it, and never where it sits in the
    middle of a sentence doing a job we cannot read.

    It is a position rule and not a parse, so it is wrong at the edges: `Ma
    olen kodus, mitte pood` would be recast. It errs toward saying nothing,
    which is the side to err on, because a correction nobody needed is read
    as the app being broken and a correction withheld is read as nothing at
