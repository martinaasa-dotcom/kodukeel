/**
 * A difficulty setting is a budget, not a mode.
 *
 * `docs/19-situations.md` §9. Each curveball costs points, the setting is how
 * many points a run may spend, and the draw is seeded. Difficulty is then one
 * number a learner can move by one, rather than four presets that jump, and it
 * sits on the scene rather than in Settings because it is a decision about this
 * conversation rather than a preference about the app.
 *
 * **Every entry names its out: the move that resolves it. A curveball with no
 * out is a trap**, and that is asserted rather than reviewed for, because the
 * out is expressed as requirements and a requirement that cannot be met inside
 * the scene's own word list is not difficulty, it is a bug in a costume.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY WRITE. English, and a lemma, which is the standing the
 * scene catalog has. Every lemma named in an out is checked against the units
 * the scene declares, word by word, the same way a beat's are.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no clock.
