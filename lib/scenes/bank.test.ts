  /*
    A BEAT THEY WILL ASK TWICE HAS TWO WAYS OF ASKING IT, or the second ask is
    the first one again, word for word.

    `patience` is how many times the other side tries again before letting a
    beat go, so a beat with patience above one is a beat a learner who is
    *engaging* meets more than once: an `incomplete` or an `offtarget` turn is
    read as `narrow`, which asks for a fresh line rather than repeating the
    heard one. The ladder passes over a scripted line this run has already
    used, so on a beat holding exactly one the scripted rung comes back empty,
    and keyless there is nothing under it: `replyFor` falls through to
    `{ text: heard, provenance: "again" }` and says the identical sentence to
    somebody whose answer was nearly right. A person rephrases. Twenty-seven
    beats were in that state when this was written, twenty-six of them
    curveballs, which is exactly where a learner is most likely to need two
    goes.

    Drawn on patience rather than on every beat, because a beat nobody asks
    twice cannot repeat itself and a second line there is a line nobody hears.
    The exemptions are the coverage test's own, for its reasons: a phrase beat
    is answered by the dictionary, a beat that waits opens with nothing, and a
    beat naming a value off the card is said by `datumLine` per run and is
    therefore never the same sentence twice anyway.
