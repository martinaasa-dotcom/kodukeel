/**
 * What a scene is, as data.
 *
 * A scene is a machine that knows the shape of an encounter without knowing
 * what anybody says in it. `docs/21-situations.md` is the design; this is the
 * half of it Phase 0 needs, because the question that decides whether the
 * module can be built at all is "how many attested sentences could fill this
 * beat", and that cannot be asked until the beats exist.
 *
 * WHAT A SCENE FILE MAY WRITE. A lemma, and nothing else. That is the standing
 * `lib/collections/syllabus/` already has: a lemma is a *request* against the
 * dictionary, so a misspelled one does not become a wrong Estonian word, it
 * fails to arrive and `scenes.test.ts` says so. What a scene may never write is
 * a sentence or a form, which is the thing ADR-005 is about, and the reason
 * every line in a finished scene comes from a recorded usage or from a model
 * working inside a closed word list with the dictionary vouching for every
 * token.
 *
 * The design doc's first invariant said "no Estonian letter in a scene file",
 * modeled on the tripwire over `lib/estonian/grammar.ts`. That was wrong and
 * building this is what showed it: a rule keyed on `õäöüšž` would allow `valu`
 * and reject `küte`, which is not a distinction about anything. The rule that
 * holds is stronger and is the one asserted: **every lemma a scene names is a
 * word one of its declared units already teaches**, so a scene cannot introduce
 * vocabulary at all, only point at vocabulary the Ekilex harvest has already
 * vouched for.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no clock.
