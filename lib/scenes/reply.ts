/**
 * What the other side says back, which is a reaction and then a move.
 *
 * The first version of this module answered every turn with the next beat's
 * line and nothing else, and a learner reported that every situation felt
 * strange. It was. They wrote `poodi` and the friend on the phone said nothing
 * about it and asked the next question; they wrote something that landed and
 * were answered "I do not understand"; they wrote one word where a sentence
 * was due and the other side asked a fresh question as if the word had never
 * been said. A person does none of that. A person says "hästi" and then asks
 * the next thing, says "I did not catch that" and asks the same thing again,
 * or says "jah?" and waits.
 *
 * So a reply is a short list of lines, and the first is how they took what was
 * said. `replyFor` is the one place that list is assembled and it is pure:
 * `state.ts` says what the other side does about the turn (`Response`),
 * `line.ts` says what Estonian the ladder could build for the next move, and
 * this decides what reaches the screen and in what order. It takes the reading
 * rather than a boolean for the reason `advance` takes `Evidence`: the repair
 * phrase may only be said about a turn `readTurn` could not read, and a caller
 * that has not marked the turn cannot call this.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY WRITE. English, in a stage direction, and nothing else. Every
 * Estonian word in a reaction is a lemma out of `REACTIONS` or the repair
 * phrase, both of which are requests against the course the catalog test
 * checks word by word (ADR-005). A stage direction is what the other side did,
 * in English, off the beat's own `they`, and it is printed only where no
 * Estonian line could be built or where a helpful persona is translating for
 * somebody who wrote English.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.

    then give up, and a learner watching that cannot tell an answer that was
    wrong from one that was in the wrong shape. `lib/scenes/coach.ts` is the
    app saying it in English, off the beat's own requirements, after a second
    miss on the same beat. It never advances anything and it is drawn as a
    note rather than as a bubble, because nobody said it.

    Once, on the turn the learner reaches the count, and not on every miss
    after it. The same paragraph printed three times running is the thing it

    a second copy would add is noise.
