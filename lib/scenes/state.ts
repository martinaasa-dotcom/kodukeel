/**
 * The machine that decides what happens next, which is never the model.
 *
 * `docs/19-situations.md` §18 names the first way this module could fail: a
 * chatbot in a costume. The guard is that the state machine decides what
 * happens, the dictionary decides what advances it, and the model writes one
 * line for one move inside a closed word list. This file is the first of
 * those three, and `advance` taking `Evidence` rather than a verdict is what
 * makes the second mechanical: `readTurn` is the only producer of `Evidence`,
 * so a caller holding a model's opinion cannot advance a scene by mistake.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO METERS (§7). No progress bar, no timer, no patience gauge:
 * every one of those turns this into a game about the gauge. Patience is a
 * number in here and it is never drawn. When it runs out the other side says
 * so, in words, and moves on, which is what a person does.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.
