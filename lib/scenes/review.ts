/**
 * The review of a conversation: what to do differently, in English.
 *
 * The debrief already said what happened and what got done. What it never
 * said is the thing a teacher says after a role-play, which is the reason
 * anybody does one: here is the ending that kept coming out wrong, here is
 * what it is for, and here is the shape of it on your own words. A learner
 * who is told "understood" eleven times and nothing else learns that they are
 * understood, which is half the job; this is the other half, and it is
 * deliberately *after* the conversation rather than inside it, because a
 * correction mid-turn is what stops people talking.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY WRITE. English, and nothing else, which is the standing
 * `lib/estonian/grammar.ts` has and for the same reason: this file explains
 * Estonian at length and holds none. Every Estonian character in a review
 * comes through `evidence`, and every one of those is either a form the
 * learner typed or a form the dictionary supplied as its recast (`Slip`).
 * The case names and the questions they are taught by are read off `CASES`,
 * the one table of what a case is called, so a note names a case the way the
 * learner's own class does. Delete every Estonian word from the comments here
 * and the output is identical.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT DO. Mark. There is no score, no percentage and no ranking
 * of the learner: a count of things achieved is the debrief's, a claim about
 * somebody's Estonian is the mock exam's alone (ADR-022), and this is advice.
 * It also never invents a fault: every note is derived from a row in the
 * transcript, so a clean run produces the one note that says so.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no network, no clock.
