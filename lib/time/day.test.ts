/*
  The bug these exist for, stated once.

  Every screen that leads with a day boundary is rendered on the server, and
  the server's day boundary is the deployment's, not the learner's. On Vercel
  that is UTC. A learner in Tallinn who studied on Monday morning, at one in
  the morning on Tuesday and again on Wednesday morning kept a three-day
  streak; in UTC days that is Monday, Monday and Wednesday, which is a broken
  streak with a hole in it.

  So these tests are written against real instants and real zone names rather
  than against offsets, and every one of them would have passed before the
  change if the machine running it happened to sit in the right zone. That is
  the whole point: `dayClock` takes the zone as an argument, so the answer is a
  property of the code rather than of the box.
