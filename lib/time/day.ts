/**
 * Calendar days, in the learner's own timezone.
 *
 * A streak is a human unit: it breaks at *their* midnight, not UTC's. Using
 * `toISOString().slice(0, 10)` — the obvious shortcut — silently shifts the day
 * boundary for anyone west of Greenwich, so someone in New York studying at
 * 8pm would have it counted as tomorrow. Estonia is UTC+2/+3, which makes the
 * bug invisible where the app was written and real everywhere else.
 *
 * THAT WAS ONLY HALF THE FIX, AND THE HALF THAT SHOWS UP IN A BROWSER.
 *
 * `getFullYear()` reads the day boundary of whichever process is running, and
 * every screen that leads with a day boundary is rendered on the server: the
 * streak, the daily goal, the quests, the week strip on Today, the heatmap.
 * On Vercel that process is UTC, so "the learner's own calendar day" was UTC's
 * calendar day wearing a different name, and the shortcut this file was
 * written to forbid was being taken one layer down.
 *
 * It is not a rounding error. A learner in Tallinn who studied on Monday
 * morning, again at one in the morning on Tuesday and again on Wednesday
 * morning has kept a three-day streak. Those three sittings fall in two UTC
 * days with a hole between them, so the app reported a streak of 1 — and, if
 * they had banked a shield, silently spent it to bridge a Tuesday they had not
 * missed. That is the worst shape this bug has: the app quietly pays a
 * penalty on the learner's behalf for something they did.
 *
 * So a day boundary now needs a timezone, and the way to get one is
 * `dayClock(zone)`. The free functions below are the same thing bound to the
 * running process's zone, which is the right answer in a browser (where the
 * process *is* the learner) and the wrong one on a server, so server code
 * takes a clock. The learner's zone is reported by their browser and stored
 * under `SETTING_KEYS.timeZone`; with none stored the clock falls back to the
 * process, which is exactly the behavior this file had before.
 *
 * Framework-free and pure: `Intl` is the platform, so both the server and the
 * browser can agree on a day key without either one guessing.
