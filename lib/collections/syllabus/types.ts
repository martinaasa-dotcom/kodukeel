 * level comes from Ekilex through `scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts`. That direction of
 * authority is the whole reason the course could get wide without anybody
 * writing Estonian (ADR-005). A lemma this file gets wrong does not become a
 * wrong word in the dictionary — it fails to arrive, and the harvest says so.
 *
 * Framework-free on purpose, like the rest of lib/collections: plain data and
 * pure functions, unit-tested without a database or a DOM.
