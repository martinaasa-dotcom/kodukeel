/**
 * WHAT THE FOUR COMMONEST-WORD LISTS ARE CALLED, ONCE.
 *
 * `lib/collections/frequency.ts` is the order and is generated, so it holds a
 * lemma, a part of speech and a group and nothing a person wrote. This is the
 * other half: what each of those four groups is called on a screen, and the one
 * line saying what is in it.
 *
 * It is a module rather than a map inside a component because four screens want
 * it now: the dictionary's lists, the card on `/practice`, the round index and
 * the round itself. That was one map in one client component, and a second copy
 * is how "Describing words" becomes "Adjectives" on one screen out of four,
 * which is the fault `lib/ux/modes.ts` and `lib/ux/nav.ts` each exist to
 * prevent.
 *
 * The slug is here too, and it is why the round's URL is `/review/common/noun`
 * rather than `/review/common/NOUN`: a path is not shouted, and a learner who
 * types one should get the page. `groupBySlug` folds case for the same reason.
 *
 * Pure, and the tone is a token name for the reason an icon is a lucide name in
 * `lib/ux/nav.ts`: this file holds no JSX and is unit tested without a DOM.

/**
 * HOW MANY WORDS ONE PRESS DEEPENS.
 *
 * `addCommonWords` puts a whole hundred in the deck with a recognition card and
 * a production card each, which is the right trade for a browsing screen: two
 * hundred cheap cards, and the list is a list of words you have collected.
 *
 * The round wants the other thing. "Used in different ways and different case
 * endings" means every card type the word can support, and for a noun that is
 * the ten regular cases plus a gap-fill on top of the two, so a hundred nouns
 * would be well over a thousand cards for one press. First run already learned
 * what that produces: ticking everything at A1 built 2,063 cards, a four year
 * backlog assembled by accident on the evening somebody installed the app.
 *
 * So the round deepens a batch at a time and the batch is twenty, which is one
 * round's worth of words and about the size of a course unit. Press it again
 * and it takes the next twenty that are not finished yet.
