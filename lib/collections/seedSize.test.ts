    twice: the measurement reported 7,127 entries where the dictionary has
    6,083. Nothing caught it, because nothing compared the two.

    Comparing the lengths alone could not see the fault it was written for. The

    expansion defers to an entry already written, and the course harvest
    *replaces* a hand-typed one, which `prisma/seed.ts` says on every run as
    "superseding 293 hand-typed ones". Read as deferring, 293 words came back
    as their hand-typed version instead, and both versions have the same lemma
    and the same part of speech, so every count came out right while the
    contents were wrong.

    What differs is the forms, the sentences and the level. `olema` is in both,
    and the harvest's row is the one carrying `on`, `oli` and `pole`; the
    measurement went on reporting those as words the dictionary could not vouch
    for after they had been stored. Counting the forms is what sees it.

    not supersede, so `koosnema` has a government card on every deployment and
