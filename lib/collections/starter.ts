/**
 * The deck somebody gets on their first evening, decided for them.
 *
 * First run used to end in a list of fourteen units with checkboxes, opened on
 * three of them, and it was the wrong question asked at the worst moment. A
 * stranger who has been using this app for ninety seconds cannot tell whether
 * they need `Riided` before `Ilm`, and the honest answer is that at A1 it does
 * not matter: the units are ordered, and the order is the answer. What the list
 * actually did was hand somebody fourteen decisions, invite them to tick all of
 * them, and then quietly build a deck of two thousand cards, which at the pace
 * this app itself calls sustainable is a two and a half year backlog assembled
 * by accident on day one.
 *
 * So the course picks. The units at the front of each level are the everyday
 * ones on purpose (plain words, greetings, people, numbers), which is what
 * somebody needs to speak, get by and follow what is said to them, and it is
 * also why no choice is being taken away by choosing: the first units at a
 * level are what anybody sensible would have ticked.
 *
 * Nothing is lost. `/learn` is the whole course, every unit has an add button,
 * and a learner who wants `Riided` on day one is two clicks from it. This is
 * the difference between a default and a restriction.
 *
 * Pure: the syllabus is a constant, so no database and no owner.

/**
 * How many units a starter deck is.
 *
 * The three that set the pace come from the arithmetic rather than from
 * taste. A card costs about ten reviews over its first year, so a daily goal
 * of fifteen sustains about two genuinely new cards a day
 * (`sustainableNewCardsPerDay`), which over five days a week is ten. Three
 * ordinary A1 units build a little over four hundred cards, so the starter
 * deck is roughly the next nine months at the default pace. Two units would
 * be under six and read as a demo; the whole level is over two years and is
 * the wall this replaced.
 *
 * A1 opens with a fourth unit now, `vastused`, thirteen single words (`tere`,
 * `aitäh`, `jah`, `ei` and nine more) ahead of `tervitused`, whose words are
 * all whole phrases. Four is what keeps `tervitused`, `inimesed` and `arvud`
 * all still arriving on day one rather than `arvud` being quietly dropped to
 * make room for it, and it barely moves the arithmetic above: `vastused`
 * builds about two dozen cards against roughly four hundred.
