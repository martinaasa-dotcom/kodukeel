/**
 * The prompts more than one word answers, and which of them are a bug.
 *
 * A production card is front `translation`, hint `pos`, back `lemma`. Two
 * entries sharing a gloss and a part of speech are one question with two right
 * answers, and the dictionary ships 372 of them. `lib/srs/cards.ts` fixes the
 * marking by putting the whole set on the back, so none of the 372 can mark a
 * right answer wrong any more.
 *
 * What a card cannot fix is a gloss that does not describe its own word, and
 * there were eleven of those. Ten were a real fault and are corrected: each one
 * now carries the Institute's own definition of its sense, rendered in English
 * in the house style the course already uses for one English word covering two
 * Estonian ones (`leib` "bread (dark)" beside `sai` "bread (white)"). So
 * `iseloom` is "character (a person's)" and `tegelane` is "character (in a
 * story)".
 *
 * The eleventh was the check being wrong. `teravmeelne` and `vaimukas` are
 * defined by naming each other, which is the Institute saying they are
 * synonyms in its own synonym-list style, and comparing the definitions as
 * strings read that as a disagreement. `sharedPrompts` knows the shape now.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY THERE IS NO DEFECT LIST HERE ANY MORE. There was one, of
 * eleven, on the argument that a list that can only shrink is honest about
 * work outstanding. It shrank to nothing, and an empty exemption list with two
 * tests around it is the parking space every exemption list becomes. The check
 * is now the flat claim: no prompt in the shipped dictionary is one its own
 * gloss cannot answer.
