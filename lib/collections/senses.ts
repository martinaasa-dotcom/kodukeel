/**
 * Two dictionary entries that ask the same question, and what to do about it.
 *
 * A production card is front `translation`, hint `pos`, back `lemma`, and it is
 * marked by `checkAnswer` against the back. So two entries with the same gloss
 * and the same part of speech are **one question with two right answers**, and
 * whichever of them the learner types, one of the two cards marks them wrong
 * and shows the card again until they stop. That is the fault the illative
 * taught this project, arriving through the vocabulary rather than through the
 * morphology. The dictionary shipped 372 of them when this was written and
 * ships 358 now (measured 2026-09-25).
 *
 * THE FIX IS THE ONE THE ILLATIVE GOT. Every accepted answer goes on the back,
 * joined the way `acceptedAnswers` already splits stored alternatives, so what
 * a screen shows and what a marker takes are the same string. `lib/srs/cards.ts`
 * does the joining and `lib/dict/facts.ts` finds the set.
 *
 * WHY THE PROMPT AND NOT THE MEANING. The first version of this grouped by
 * Ekilex's own definition, on the reasoning that two words the Institute gives
 * one definition are one meaning. That found twelve pairs and missed ten more,
 * because the fault is not that two words mean the same thing. It is that one
 * card cannot tell them apart, and a card knows nothing but its front. Grouping
 * by `sameMeaning` was tried too and is worse in the other direction: it is
 * built for "could these be offered as different answers to one question" and
 * is deliberately generous, so it called `abi` "help" and `aitama` "to help"
 * one prompt, which no learner reading the hint would confuse.
 *
 * WHAT EKILEX'S DEFINITION IS STILL FOR. It is the diagnosis rather than the
 * trigger. Where the Institute gives the group one definition, they really are
 * synonyms and there is nothing to fix beyond accepting both. (This used to
 * cite `ja` and `ning` as a pair no gloss could separate; `ning` has since been
 * glossed "and (joining the last of a list)", so they are no longer one
 * prompt.) Where it gives them two, the
 * gloss is failing to identify its own word, which is a different and worse
 * bug: `iseloom` is a person's character and `tegelane` is a character in a
 * story, and both are glossed "character". Accepting both is still the fair
 * thing to do while that is true, because the learner is being punished for a
 * prompt that cannot be answered, but the gloss is what wants fixing.
 *
 * AND THE INSTITUTE SAYS "SYNONYM" IN TWO WAYS, NOT ONE. Comparing the
 * definitions as strings reads only the first of them. Where Ekilex has
 * nothing to say beyond naming the neighbors, its definition *is* a list of
 * synonyms: `teravmeelne` is defined as "vaimukas, nutikas, leidlik" and
 * `vaimukas` as "teravmeelne, ootamatu ja leidlik". Two different strings, and
 * each one names the other word. Read as a disagreement, that pair sat on the
 * defect list asking somebody to invent a distinction the language does not
 * have, which is the one repair worse than leaving a gloss alone.
 *
 * Pure: plain data in, plain data out. The caller supplies the entries.

 *
 * Two entries are the interesting ones and both were set by narrowing until
 * something honest complained, rather than by widening until nothing did.
 *
 * ADVERB is this course's bucket for an uninflecting function word: `kas`,
 * `kui` and `palju` were ADVERB before any connective unit existed, and the
 * harvest's own comment says demanding forms for one "would drop every single
 * connective in the course". It was first written wide enough to admit `s` and
 * `v` as well, on the assumption that something would need it. Nothing did:
 * every ADVERB in the course is `adv`, `konj`, `prep` or `interj` to Ekilex, so
 * the wide version was a check that could not have fired.
 *
 * `num` on NOUN and ADJECTIVE is the one genuine widening, and it is a fact
 * about what the app needs rather than a shrug. An Estonian numeral declines,
 * so `kakskümmend` has to be a nominal here or it gets no case table and the
 * numbers unit teaches nothing about `kahekümne`. The ordinal `teine` agrees
 * like an adjective, which is what it is labeled. Ekilex calls all five of
