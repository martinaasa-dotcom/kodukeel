/**
 * ONE THING TO SAY TO A REAL PERSON, AND WHETHER ANYTHING WAS SAID AT ALL.
 *
 * Every other panel on Today is about the app: what is due, what is next,
 * what keeps going wrong. This one is about leaving it. An errand is a small
 * real-world task in English, tied to a unit of the course.
 *
 * THE CARD ASKS ABOUT YESTERDAY, AND THE ERRAND IS WHAT IT OFFERS WHEN THE
 * ANSWER IS NO. It used to set the errand in the morning and put the three
 * answers under it, which asked for a report on something that had not
 * happened yet: three buttons at eight in the morning are three ways to make
 * a card go away rather than an account of anything. And it could only ever
 * see conversations this app had set, so a learner who spent an hour with
 * their Estonian mother-in-law and ignored the errand was recorded as having
 * done nothing, in the one number this app claims to be measured by.
 *
 * So the question is always about a day that is over, the answer is always
 * about the learner's own life rather than about our homework, and the errand
 * is a small one for today offered to somebody who says there was nothing
 * yesterday. That report is the number no learning app keeps, because their
 * business is keeping you inside: conversations held outside, and how often
 * the other person gave up on your Estonian.
 *
 * NO ESTONIAN HERE. An errand names a unit id, the way `topical.ts` does, and
 * never a word: the words the errand needs are the unit's, already in the
 * dictionary, and the card links to them. A hand-written phrase in this file
 * would be this project writing Estonian and the first misspelling shipping in
 * silence (ADR-005).
 *
 * An errand is offered only where the learner has started its unit, because
 * "order a coffee" to somebody who has not met `kohv` is a dare rather than a
 * task. The two that need only greetings are always available.
 *
 * THE WALK IS OVER THE WHOLE LIST AND THE FILTER COMES AFTER IT. This said the
 * same errand "does not come round for weeks", which is true of somebody who
 * has started every unit and false of everybody else: the pool is the units a
 * learner has begun, four of them on a starter deck, and `dayIndex` over a pool
 * of four repeats every four days. The interval is the pool size, which is a
 * fact about how far in the learner is rather than a promise this file can
 * make, and it is why the card appears on a minority of days.
 *
 * AND THE MODULUS IS THE POOL, WHICH MEANS STARTING A UNIT CHANGES TODAY'S. It
 * renumbers the walk, so a learner who begins a unit at lunchtime can be shown
 * a different errand from the one the card offered that morning. Walking the
 * fixed list instead and stepping forward to the first available errand was
 * tried and is worse where it matters: measured over twenty days on a starter
 * deck it lands on `hello` eleven times in twelve, because stepping forward
 * gives the errand with the most unavailable entries in front of it the largest
 * catchment. An even walk over a pool needs the pool's size, so the two cannot
 * both be had. Variety wins, because the learner with four errands is the one
 * who would pay for the other choice, and because the card is only offered on a
 * day the answer was no.
 *
 * Pure.
