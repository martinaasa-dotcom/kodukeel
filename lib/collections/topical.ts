/**
 * What time of year it is, in words a learner in Estonia would actually meet.
 *
 * The dictionary's suggestion row wants to feel like it was chosen this
 * morning rather than generated once. The news feed does most of that work,
 * but a feed can be unreachable, switched off, or having a bad minute, and the
 * calendar never is: on the first of September there is one obvious set of
 * words, and it is not the same set as the one for midsummer.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS AUTHORED ESTONIAN. Every window names *unit ids from the
 * course*, and the words come out of `lib/collections/syllabus/`, where a
 * lemma is already a request the Ekilex harvest either honored or reported.
 * That is the whole reason this is a table of ids rather than a table of
 * words: a hand-written seasonal word list would be somebody writing Estonian
 * into the app (ADR-005), and the first misspelling would ship silently.
 * `topical.test.ts` fails if an id here is not a unit.
 *
 * Estonia's year, not a generic one. School starts on the first of September
 * and the day has a name; the twenty-fourth of February is the independence
 * day; midsummer is the week the country stops. A seasonal table written for
 * somewhere else would be worse than no table.
 *
 * Pure data and one function over a date, like the rest of lib/collections.
