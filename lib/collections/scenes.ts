/**
 * SITUATIONS TO WRITE ABOUT, AND THE THINGS IN THEM.
 *
 * The feedback asked for two games: describe a picture, and hold a
 * conversation in a situation. They are one thing. What both are for is the
 * moment a learner has to produce Estonian about something in front of them
 * rather than recall the back of a card, and the difference between them is
 * only what sets the scene: a picture, or a place.
 *
 * So a scene is both. A situation named in English, and three things in it.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO ARTWORK. The picture game was approved as cartoon drawings,
 * and nothing in this project can draw one: a model that generates an image is
 * a license question nobody here can answer, a file per scene to ship, and
 * sixty of them before a round stops repeating. The things in a scene are
 * emoji, which is the argument `/review/emoji` already made and won. They are
 * characters drawn by the reader's own font, so nothing ships, no license is
 * carried, and every one of them is already joined to a dictionary headword by
 * `scripts/build-emoji.ts` against Unicode's own data file.
 *
 * WHAT IS AUTHORED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. The situation is English, which is
 * the one language this project may write. The three words are **requests**,
 * exactly as a syllabus unit's lemmas are: naming one here does not make it a
 * word, it asks whether the dictionary has one, and `scenes.test.ts` fails on
 * a name `lib/collections/emoji.ts` does not carry. No Estonian sentence is
 * written anywhere in this file, and none is written anywhere in the mode it
 * feeds: the learner writes the Estonian, the dictionary marks it, and the
 * model answer beside it comes from a lexicographer or from a native speaker
 * who typed it into a form (ADR-005).
 *
 * NO LEVEL IS DECLARED. A scene is as hard as its hardest word, and which band
 * that word is in is a fact about the dictionary that a reseed can move. A
 * level written down here would be a second answer to it, and the first thing
 * a second answer does is go stale. `lib/progress/describe.ts` reads the bands
 * off the entries and keeps the scenes whose words are all within one band of
 * the learner, which is `bandsAround`, the same table every other screen uses.
 *
 * The ids are English slugs and are keys rather than words: a contributed
 * sentence attaches to one, so renaming one orphans somebody's work. The
 * syllabus makes the same argument about its unit ids.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no Prisma, no clock.
