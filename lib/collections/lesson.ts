/**
 * Turning a unit into a lesson.
 *
 * Before this existed, opening a unit offered two buttons: add its words to the
 * deck, or drill the unit. Both are flashcards, so a "course" of 83 units was 83
 * ways to arrive at the same rectangle. This module is the difference between a
 * word list and a lesson.
 *
 * Three rules shape a plan, and they are the whole answer to "why is this not
 * boring":
 *
 * 1. **Nothing is asked before it is taught.** A word is met — shown with its
 *    gloss and a real sentence — before anything is asked about it, and asked
 *    for recognition before it is asked for production. Being made to produce a
 *    word you have never seen is a guessing game, and losing it teaches nothing.
 *
 * 2. **No two consecutive *questions* of the same kind.** Six multiple-choice
 *    questions in a row is the exact texture of tedium, and it is what every
 *    naive generator produces. Variety comes from `interleave`, which merges
 *    one lane per kind so a cycle through the lanes is a cycle through kinds;
 *    `repairRuns` then mops up what the lanes could not, which is the tail of a
 *    lesson where only one lane is still running. Teaching cards are exempt:
 *    meeting three new words in a row is a presentation, not a grind.
 *
 * 3. **Words come back inside the lesson, not just tomorrow.** A word met in the
 *    first block is asked again several steps later, harder. Spacing is the one
 *    thing that turns exposure into memory, and waiting for the SRS to do all of
 *    it wastes the session the learner is already in.
 *
 * Everything a step contains is either English (ours to write) or Estonian that
 * came from the dictionary — a lemma, a stored form, a derived case, or an
 * attested sentence hidden or shuffled by `lib/estonian/cloze`. Nothing here
 * generates Estonian, and the distractors in a multiple choice are real words
 * from the learner's own level rather than invented near-misses (ADR-005).
 *
 * Pure and framework-free: no React, no Prisma, no clock. The page resolves the
 * dictionary rows and hands them in.
