/**
 * A printable worksheet for one unit.
 *
 * The feature a real Estonian course asks for and no flashcard app has: paper.
 * Teachers hand out worksheets, and a course that lives only behind a login is
 * a course half the class does at home and nobody does in the room. This turns
 * a unit into a sheet with an answer key on the back.
 *
 * Every exercise is built from material the dictionary already holds — attested
 * sentences from Ekilex, principal parts from the seed — and nothing is
 * generated. A gap-fill is a real sentence with one of its own words hidden; a
 * case table is a table with cells left out. That is the whole trick, and it is
 * the same one the cloze cards use (ADR-005, ADR-017).
 *
 * Deterministic on purpose. Printing the same unit twice has to produce the same
 * sheet, or a class ends up comparing answers to two different worksheets.

      AND THE GAP MAY NOT BE THE WORD IN THE BRACKET BESIDE IT.

      The sheet prints the lemma after the blank and heads the section "Put the
      word in brackets into the right form", so a gap whose answer is the lemma
      is answered by copying the bracket. `gapForms` includes the headword
      itself, deliberately, because a nominative standing in a sentence is a
      form; every other caller keeps that and none of them prints the lemma an
      inch away. Measured over the shipped dictionary, 1,519 of 4,214 buildable
      gaps were the word beside them, which is a third of every sheet a class
      works through, and it is the commonest shape rather than an edge: a
      lexicographer illustrating a noun usually writes it in the nominative.

      3,389 of those words have another sentence whose gap is inflected, which
      is the exercise this was always meant to be and what the comment above has
      said since it was written. The rest get no gap: the sheet still prints
      their meaning and their case table, and a question answered by its own
      hint is worth less than a line of paper.
