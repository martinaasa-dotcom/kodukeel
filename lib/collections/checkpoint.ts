/**
 * The exam at the end of a level.
 *
 * A checkpoint is not another unit and deliberately not another lesson. It
 * teaches nothing, offers no options to pick between, and draws on the whole
 * level at once rather than one theme — because the question it answers is
 * whether a level is finished or merely visited, and recognition cannot answer
 * that. Four options give a quarter of the marks away to somebody who knows
 * nothing.
 *
 * So every question is production: either write the word from its English gloss,
 * or fill its form into a sentence a lexicographer recorded. Both are typed, and
 * both are graded by `lib/estonian/answer`, which tells a dropped diacritic from
 * a typo from a wrong word — so `soda` for `sõda` is called out by name rather
 * than being waved through or failed flat.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free, like the rest of lib/collections.
