/**
 * A LEARNER'S OWN ESTONIAN WEEK.
 *
 * Almost everybody using this is also sitting in a class, and the two halves of
 * their week live in different places: the class is on Monday and Wednesday
 * evening, and the homework and the review sittings go in the gaps. The app
 * knew about the second half (`Task` has a due date and Today draws it) and
 * nothing at all about the first.
 *
 * This is the arithmetic of a week: which days it holds, which events fall on
 * each of them, and how a span of time reads. It holds no Prisma, no React and
 * no clock of its own, for the reason `lib/ux/agenda.ts` gives at length: "due
 * today" is a question about the learner's own midnight, and every day-shaped
 * figure in this app that reached for the process's clock has been wrong for
 * anybody outside the deployment's zone.
 *
 * A REPEATING EVENT STORES A WALL CLOCK, NOT AN INSTANT. A class at 18:00 every
 * Monday is at 18:00 in March and in November; a stored timestamp is not, it
 * moves an hour when the clocks change. So `startMinute` is minutes from local
 * midnight and `weekdays` says which days it lands on, and the learner's own
 * zone is what turns that into a moment.
