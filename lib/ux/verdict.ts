/**
 * WHAT A RIGHT ANSWER LOOKS LIKE, AND A WRONG ONE, EVERYWHERE.
 *
 * Twenty screens mark an answer, and each one used to paint its own verdict
 * out of the tokens by hand: a tint here, a fill there, an ink on some, the
 * hue itself on others. The palette had already decided what the colors mean
 * (docs/14-design-system.md §1: mint is recalled, butter is nearly, peach is
 * missed), so nothing was wrong on purpose. What went wrong was the copying.
 * Four rounds wrote a verdict in the fill at 2.2:1, one round never marked the
 * option the learner actually pressed, another marked a near miss the same
 * peach as a blank, and the picture board said nothing in color at all.
 *
 * So there is one vocabulary and this is it. A verdict is one of three words,
 * and each names a class in `app/globals.css` that paints the tint and writes
 * in the ink, in both themes. An option, once the answer is known, is one of
 * three others: the right one, the one the learner pressed when it was not,
 * and the rest. Every screen that marks an answer reads these; none paints a
 * verdict tint by hand, and `scripts/test-invariants.ts` fails on one that
 * does.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no tokens, no color. The color lives in the stylesheet,
 * where the theme can flip it.

 * How long a marked answer stays on the screen before the next card comes.
 *
 * A right pick and a right typed answer used to move on after 420 ms, which
 * is under the time it takes to look from the option you pressed to the tint
 * it turned: a learner reported the card "flashing away" before they knew
 * whether they had it. It went to 1,100 ms for that, and a second learner
 * reported the same thing again: long enough to register the tint has
 * changed color is not long enough to read the word it changed on, and a
 * card met for the first time carries a gloss and a sentence worth a second
 * look. Three seconds and a bit is that reading time, not just the blink of
 * a color. Undo is still there for the moment somebody wanted longer still.
