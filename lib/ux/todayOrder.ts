/**
 * WHICH ORDER THE CARDS ON TODAY ARE DEALT IN, AND WHOSE CHOICE THAT IS.
 *
 * Today names its cards in priority order and draws the first `TODAY_CARDS`
 * of them (lib/ux/disclosure.ts). The order shipped with an argument behind
 * it, what to say to a real person, what is actually on today, the one short
 * round, the run of days, a word, and then the course, and the argument is
 * still the default. It is not the only honest order. Somebody in a class
 * wants the homework at the top; somebody who plays the game every morning
 * wants it first; somebody who never sets a calendar wants the word of the
 * day above an empty slot. A home page is the one screen whose reading order
 * is a fact about the reader rather than about the app, so it is theirs to
 * set, from Settings.
 *
 * WHAT IS CHOSEN IS THE ORDER AND NOTHING ELSE. The cap still applies after
 * the deal, so moving a card up is also what decides whether it survives the
 * cut; the disclosure table still decides whether a card is worth drawing at
 * all for somebody this far in; and a card with nothing to say this morning
 * is still absent whatever position it holds. Ordering never adds a seventh
 * box, and it never draws a card the learner is not ready for.
 *
 * ONE STRING, LIKE THE GOAL REASONS. The stored value is the slot ids in
 * order, space separated, which is the shape `goalReason` already takes, so
 * a row written by hand or by an older build reads back without a migration.
 * Reading is forgiving on purpose: an id this file no longer knows is
 * dropped, a duplicate is kept once, and any slot the row leaves out is
 * appended in the default order, so a card added to Today after somebody set
 * their order still appears rather than silently never being dealt.
 *
 * Pure: a string in, an order out. No React, no Prisma, no clock.
