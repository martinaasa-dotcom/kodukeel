/**
 * THE ESTONIAN LETTER BAR: WHICH LETTERS IT OFFERS, AND WHETHER IT IS DRAWN.
 *
 * Two facts that were previously three copies of one and a decision nobody had
 * made. The six letters were a `DIACRITICS` constant in `EstonianInput` and a
 * second `DIACRITICS` constant in `DiacriticBar`, and the bar was drawn for
 * everybody, everywhere, always.
 *
 * That last part is the fault this module exists for. A learner in Tallinn is
 * typing on an Estonian keyboard, where õ is a key next to ä; a row of buttons
 * offering to type it for them is clutter under every field in the app, on the
 * exam paper and the dictation screen included. A learner on a UK or US layout
 * has no way to write õ at all short of an alt code, so the same row is the
 * only thing making half these exercises answerable.
 *
 * WHICH ONE SOMEBODY IS CANNOT BE DETECTED. There is no way to ask a browser
 * what is printed on the keys: `KeyboardEvent.key` reports what was typed, and
 * a learner who never reaches for õ looks identical to one who cannot. So it is
 * asked, once, at first run, and changed whenever they like.
 *
 * ON IS THE DEFAULT AND STAYS THE DEFAULT. Everybody who signed up before this
 * existed is never asked, and a missing answer must not quietly take away the
 * only way they have of writing õ. Defaulting the other way would break those
 * learners silently, which is the worse of the two failures by a distance.
