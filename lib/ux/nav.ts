/**
 * Every destination in the app, and which section it belongs to.
 *
 * There used to be one flat list of sixteen links with four of them promoted
 * and the other twelve behind a button marked "More". That is not a fix for a
 * cluttered rail, it is the clutter moved somewhere a learner has to remember.
 * Worse, it had a bug that only showed up once you used it: the group opened
 * itself whenever the current page was inside it, so on Practice or Progress
 * or Grammar the button read "Less" and pressing it did nothing at all. The
 * flag went false, the derived value stayed true, and the rail never moved.
 *
 * So the sections are the fix and hiding is not. Sixteen links in one column
 * are a list to read; the same sixteen under four headings are four short
 * answers to "where do I go for this", and every one of them is on the screen
 * the whole time. The groups are the questions a learner actually asks:
 *
 *   - what do I do now
 *   - what does this word mean
 *   - how am I doing
 *
 * Three rather than the four it opened with. "Where am I in the course" turned
 * out to be the same question as "what do I do now": Learn is the ladder the
 * next five words climb and the map they come off, and a learner standing on
 * one wants the other in the same breath.
 *
 * Nothing here decides *whether* to show a destination. That question is
 * `lib/ux/disclosure.ts`, it is about what a screen leads with, and it is a
 * different question from where a thing lives. A destination this module names
 * is always in the navigation, at every stage, from the first minute.
 *
 * One table, read by three surfaces: the desktop rail, the phone sheet and the
 * command palette. Three copies of a list of screens is how a screen ends up
 * reachable from two of them and missing from the third.
 *
 * Pure: strings in, strings out. The icon is a lucide *name* and
 * `components/icons.tsx` is the only place that turns one into a component,
 * which is what keeps this file importable by a unit test.

   *     press.
   *
   * The value is where it is reached from, so this file says so rather than
   * leaving the next reader to find out, and it names a place the rail lists.

          Which words are known, which are nearly, and which keep going wrong.
          The first version was a panel three cards down `/words` and the
          learner reported that they could not find it anywhere. The second
          gave it a page and a `within: "/words"`, on the argument every other
          entry here makes: it is reached from the deck it counts and from
          Practice, which is the screen somebody is standing on when they want
          it. The learner reported the same thing again.

          has no row anywhere and no signpost either: the rail says Progress,
          Progress links to the deck, and the deck carries a button. Three
          steps to a list somebody asked for by name twice. `nav.test.ts` holds
          the general rule now, that a `within` points at somewhere the rail
          actually lists, and this was the only entry breaking it.

          It sits here rather than under the deck because it answers this
          section's own question, "how is it going", in the one unit a learner
