/**
 * Every way to practice, once.
 *
 * There were four lists of these. Today carried six tiles with one wording,
 * `/practice` carried eleven modes with another, `components/PracticeModes.tsx`
 * carried seven with a third and no screen rendered it at all, and the command
 * palette carried six more. The same mode was called "60 seconds, weak cards"
 * on one screen and "60 seconds" on the next, Sentences was `accent` here and
 * `blush` there, and adding a mode meant remembering four files, which is how
 * a mode ends up on two screens and missing from the other two.
 *
 * So this is the table and the screens read it. What a mode *is* lives here;
 * what it is like *right now* does not, because that is a database query and
 * this module has none. `/practice` computes "12 ready" or "Best: 38" and
 * hands it in beside the row.
 *
 * Two groups, and the split is how long the thing takes rather than how hard
 * it is: `quick` is a round you can finish waiting for a bus, `targeted` is
 * what you open when you already know what is going wrong.
 *
 * Pure, and the icon is a lucide *name* for the reason `lib/ux/nav.ts` gives.
