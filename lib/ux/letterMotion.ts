/**
 * HOW A LOOSE LETTER MOVES, AND HOW IT ANSWERS A POINTER.
 *
 * õ, ä, ö and ü are the four letters an English keyboard has no key for, which
 * is the single most concrete thing about learning to write Estonian, so they
 * are what this app decorates itself with. They were four squares doing one
 * three or four pixel wander on four periods of the same shape. That is a page
 * that is technically alive and reads as still: a reader has to watch one for
 * several seconds to notice it moved at all.
 *
 * A CHARACTER IS A RHYTHM, NOT A DISTANCE. How far a letter may travel is a
 * fact about the room the caller has, and the caller is the only one who knows
 * it: a letter tucked over the case card has about four pixels before it lands
 * on a word, and one loose in the hero has forty. So a character here supplies
 * the shape of the movement, the period, the rock and the squash, and every
 * caller hands in its own travel. Four characters rather than one, because the
 * argument against four squares rising together on one bob is the same
 * argument against four squares wandering together on one keyframe.
 *
 * THE TRAVEL IS ALONG THE EDGE, WHICH IS WHERE THE ROOM IS. A letter tucked
 * over the top of a card has a card underneath it and a heading above it, so
 * it has almost nothing vertically and the whole width of the card sideways.
 * `freeAxis` is that fact, and it is what lets these move far enough to be
 * worth watching: sliding thirty pixels along an edge is visible from across a
 * room and costs the placement nothing, where three pixels toward the card is
 * invisible and spends the whole budget.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE READS THE DOM. It is arithmetic on numbers a component
 * measured, so the reach and the lean can be reasoned about in a test rather
 * than in a browser. `components/LetterTile.tsx` does the measuring.

 * ambles and returns by another route, the hopper crouches and springs and
 * lands heavily, the swinger is a pendulum that barely goes anywhere, and the
 * tumbler rolls: most of its budget is spent on the rotation.
 *
 * THE PERIODS ARE SHORT ENOUGH TO CATCH. The first table had the wanderer on
 * 5.5 seconds and the tumbler on 6.7, over a travel of 26 to 30 pixels, and
 * the page was measured moving and reported as still: a square covering a
 * hand's width in six seconds is a square nobody sees move unless they are
 * already watching it. Every period came down by a fifth and every rock and
 * squash went up by about a third, so a glance catches one mid-hop. The
 * periods still share no common measure, which is what keeps four letters
 * from falling into step.
