/**
 * How much of this app a learner is shown, and when.
 *
 * The feedback that produced this module was that the app is overwhelming for
 * somebody just getting started, and the cause was not any one screen. It was
 * that every screen showed everything the app can do to everybody, from the
 * first minute. Today led with three figures, a ring, an XP meter, a week
 * strip, three quests, a task list, a unit card, six practice tiles, a word to
 * revisit and a tutor pitch, and most of those are meaningless to somebody who
 * has never graded a card: a streak of nought, a goal ring at nought percent,
 * a "word to revisit" drawn from a deck they have not read yet.
 *
 * So the rule is one table rather than a ternary per panel, and it lives here
 * rather than in the pages, because the fault it fixes is precisely that each
 * screen decided on its own and every one of them decided "show it".
 *
 * Two thresholds, and both are the learner's own history rather than a clock:
 *
 *   - `arriving` until they have graded a single card. A figure computed from
 *     an empty log is not information, it is furniture.
 *   - `starting` until roughly three days at the default goal. The daily loop
 *     and the reason to come back tomorrow are what matter; the charts,
 *     history and long-run tools have nothing to say yet.
 *   - `settled` after that, which is the app as it was.
 *
 * Nothing is *removed* by any of this. Every panel a stage withholds is still
 * reachable from the navigation, the command palette and its own page. This
 * decides what a screen leads with, which is a different question from what
 * the app contains, and it is the question the first ten minutes turn on.
 *
 * WHAT "COMPUTED FROM AN EMPTY LOG" DOES AND DOES NOT COVER, because the first
 * version of this table read it far too widely and day one paid for it.
 *
 * A streak of nought is furniture. A goal ring at nought percent is furniture.
 * A level bar at 40 XP out of 300 is furniture. Those are the panels this rule
 * was written for and they are still held back.
 *
 * The word of the day is not one of them: it comes out of the dictionary, it
 * is chosen by the date rather than by anything the learner has done, and it
 * reads exactly the same on the first morning as in the second year. It was
 * held back anyway, on the strength of not being the review button, and the
 * result was a home page with two cards on it that a learner reasonably read
 * as an app with nothing in it. Restraint that leaves a screen looking broken
 * is not restraint.
 *
 * So the test a panel has to pass is "does this say something true and useful
 * on a log with nothing in it", not "is this the way in".
 *
 * AND THE TABLE IS HALF THE ANSWER, WHICH IS WHAT `TODAY_CARDS` IS FOR. A
 * panel worth drawing is not the same claim as a panel worth one of the six
 * boxes on the screen everybody opens with two minutes to spare. See the
 * constant at the foot of this file.
 *
 * Pure: counts in, names out. No React, no Prisma, no clock.

 * thing on the page this morning", which is a question about the page, and
 * that is the one Today was getting wrong: every panel a stage allowed was
 * drawn, so a settled learner opened fourteen cards, ten of which were reports
 * rather than things to do today. Somebody with two minutes before the bus

 * because the hero above them is the sixth, and six is what fits on a phone
 * screen and a half: a card that has to be hunted for is a card that is not
 * being glanced at, which is the whole job of this screen.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted by this either. A card the cap drops is on its own page,
 * in the rail and in the palette, exactly as with the table above. What it
 * decides is which five earn the one screen everybody opens every morning.
