/**
 * How often one learner may run the actions that do real work per call.
 *
 * THE GATE WAS ON THE WRONG DOOR, AND ONLY ON ONE OF THEM.
 *
 * Five Route Handlers call `checkRateLimit`. Every mutation a learner makes
 * here is a Server Action instead, which is a POST to a page path, and not one
 * of the forty-odd of them had a throttle. The same-origin gate and
 * `requireUserId` mean this is not reachable by an anonymous scraper, so this
 * is not the hole `/api/tutor` would be without its limiter — but sign-up is
 * open by default, and one signed-in account could call any action as fast as
 * it liked. `serverActions.bodySizeLimit` is 16 MB, raised for backup
 * restores and therefore the ceiling on *every* action's payload, so a loop
 * posting near-16 MB bodies at a database-touching action had nothing in the
 * app slowing it down.
 *
 * Not every action needs one. Grading a card, starring a word or toggling a
 * task is a single indexed write, and a person tapping quickly is a person
 * using the app: a limit there would be felt by learners and by nobody else.
 * What is listed here is the work that is genuinely per-call expensive — a
 * whole passage scanned against the dictionary, a backup parsed and written
 * row by row, a class roster read and written, a table of forms built and stored.
 *
 * The numbers are deliberately far above real use. A person importing three
 * word lists in a minute should never meet one of these; a script should meet
 * it immediately. They are a ceiling on abuse, not a pace for anybody.
