/**
 * A best-effort, per-instance rate limiter for the routes that spend
 * somebody else's quota.
 *
 * `/api/tutor`, `/api/write` and `/api/exam/write` each cost money or burn a
 * free model's daily allowance; `/api/scan` costs a vision call; `/api/tts` is
 * a free academic service run by the University of Tartu, and being a polite
 * consumer of it is stated in that route already; `/api/share` renders an image
 * per call; `/api/export` reads every table this account owns and `/api/restore`
 * parses a file the caller chose the size of. None of that needs a distributed
 * limiter, and this deliberately is not one: buckets live in the memory of
 * one warm instance, so a burst spread across cold starts can slip past. It
 * still catches the pattern that actually happens, which is one retry loop or
 * one script hammering one endpoint, and it costs no infrastructure at all.
 * Swap it for a shared store the day the traffic justifies one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT A BACKSTOP FOR, since it used to be described as
 * though it were the first line of defense for spending. It is not. On
 * serverless a burst spread across cold starts meets an empty Map every time,
 * so the thing that actually bounds cost is the Postgres ledger in
 * `lib/usage/`, which reserves a call inside the same transaction that reads
 * the counters and is therefore the same number whichever instance answers.
 * This limiter is in front of that to keep an obvious loop from making a
 * hundred database round trips on its way to being refused.
 *
 * AND THE FOUR ROUTES THE LEDGER DOES NOT PRICE NO LONGER RELY ON IT ALONE.
 * Speech, the share card, the export and the restore used to have this Map and
 * nothing else, which made the honest description of their limit "however many
 * instances happen to be warm". That is the first question a buyer's engineer
 * asks and the right one to ask. `lib/usage/sharedLimit.ts` counts those in a
 * row every instance can see, and calls straight through to this function
 * first, so a caller who is already over is still refused for free and the
 * loop this was written for still costs no round trip. What lives here is the
 * cheap verdict and the two pure pieces at the bottom that both limiters have
 * to agree on.
 *
 * THE LIST ABOVE USED TO SAY "THREE OF THEM" AND NAME THREE, and it was five
 * by then. That is how `/api/write` went without one: it is `/api/exam/write`
 * with a different prompt, its twin was throttled from the day it landed, and
 * the only difference between them was which had been written first. Prose
 * kept four routes honest and did not catch the fifth, which is the argument
 * `lib/usage/ledger.ts` makes about itself, so an invariant reads the routes
 * rather than this paragraph.
