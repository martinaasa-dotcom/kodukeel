/**
 * Leeches: the handful of cards a learner keeps failing.
 *
 * Every SRS accumulates them, and the standard answer — bury the card once it
 * has lapsed N times — is a dodge dressed as a feature. It removes the symptom
 * and learns nothing, and the learner is left with a word they still cannot use.
 *
 * The failure history is data nobody was reading. A card that has been failed
 * six times has six timestamps, six ratings and, for a case-form card, the case
 * it was asked about — enough to say *how* it is failing, which is the thing a
 * teacher would ask before offering advice.
 *
 * Pure: the caller queries, this decides what counts as a leech and what shape
 * the failure has.
