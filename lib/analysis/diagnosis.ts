/**
 * What the learner is actually bad at.
 *
 * The existing weak-case heatmap answers "which case do you fail most", which is
 * the obvious question and the less useful one. Estonian errors do not cluster
 * by case; they cluster by *case interacting with stem shape*. Someone can be
 * perfectly comfortable with the partitive of `raamat` and fail it every time on
 * a gradating word like `tuba`, because the difficulty was never the case ending
 * — it was the stem it attaches to.
 *
 * So the finding this produces is not "you are weak at the partitive" but "you
 * are fine at the partitive except on gradating stems", which names something a
 * learner can go and study. Nothing else on the market can say it, and this app
 * can only say it because `lib/estonian/gradation` already classifies stems and
 * `Review` already records `targetCase` — the join was always available.
 *
 * Pure. The caller does the query; this does the thinking.
