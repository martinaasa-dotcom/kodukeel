 * its own is a question most learners cannot answer, because CEFR letters mean
 * nothing until somebody tells you that B1 is the exam naturalization asks for
 * and that B2 is where you stop translating in your head. So the reason comes
 * first, each reason carries the level it usually implies, and the level is
 * described by what a person can do at it rather than by its letter.
 *
 * The deadline matters more than it looks. It is the only input that turns a
 * projection from a fact about languages into a fact about this person's year,
 * and it is what lets the plan screen say "not by then, and here is what would
 * have to change" instead of a number nobody can act on.
 *
