/**
 * What a placement check is made of.
 *
 * The whole feature rests on one constraint: **every Estonian string in an item
 * comes from the dictionary**, never from this app and never from a model
 * (ADR-005, ADR-017). A test that invented its own Estonian would be worse than
 * no test at all, because a learner would be marked wrong for disagreeing with
 * something nobody attested. So an item carries the Estonian it shows *and*
 * where that Estonian came from, and the runner prints the provenance beside it.
 *
 * The English half is ours to write: the questions are metalanguage, and the
 * options for a meaning question are the glosses already stored against the
 * words. Nothing here translates, and nothing here inflects.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free, like `lib/estonian/`.
