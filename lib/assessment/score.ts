 * Marking, and turning marks into a level.

 * Two rules shape everything here.
 *
 * **No model marks anything.** A choice item is marked against a stored index,
 * a dictation against the sentence a lexicographer recorded, a written sentence
 * against a form the dictionary vouches for. That is the same ordering the
 * writing exercise already uses: the form is checked by string comparison
 * before any call is made, so a hallucination cannot mark a right answer wrong.
 * A placement test is where that would hurt most, because the learner has no
 * way yet to know the machine is the one that is confused.
 *
 * **Speaking is never scored.** There is no verified Estonian speech recognizer
 * available here (ADR-018), so the speaking section collects the learner's own
 * rating, reports it as theirs, and contributes nothing to the level. A number
 * invented on top of a recognizer that does not support Estonian would be
 * trusted, which is exactly what makes it worse than silence.

/**
 * The level a set of band scores supports.
 *
 * **The highest band passed consecutively, starting from the bottom.** That is
 * the rule every published CEFR placement test scores on, and it is not what
 * this function used to do. The old version raised the level on any band that
 * cleared `PASS` and only stopped climbing on one that came in under `FLOOR`,
 * so the whole range between half and two thirds was a band the learner had
 * visibly not passed and was promoted straight past anyway: A1 at 100%, A2 at
 * 55% and B1 at 70% reported B1, on the strength of a band underneath it that
 * the same result screen was about to print as failed.
 *
 * That gap is where a four-option question lands most often, because 55% is
 * roughly what a learner scores at a band they half know and exactly what
 * guessing plus a little knowledge looks like. A level is a claim about
 * everything you can do at it, so a band that was asked and not passed ends
 * the climb, whatever happens above it.
 *
 * A band that was never asked is not evidence either way, so it is stepped
 * over rather than read as a failure. On a full paper that does not arise; on
 * a dictionary too thin to fill a band it is the difference between reporting
 * the level the answered questions support and reporting `pre-A1` to somebody
 * who answered everything correctly.
 *
 * **And the floor is the band below the lowest one asked, not always `pre-A1`.**
 * Writing has no A1 question and structurally cannot: its task is choosing the
 * ending a sentence needs, which is a step past reading the word, so
 * `writingItems` raises every gap to A2 for the same reason the reading gaps
 * are raised. Starting the count at `pre-A1` regardless then read a failed A2
 * as "below A1" on the strength of a band nobody had been asked about, and
 * since the overall level then followed the *weakest* skill, that put "below A1" on
 * the result of anybody whose writing was not yet A2. Measured on the shipped
 * dictionary, writing comes out A1:0 at every seed, so it was not an edge
 * case, it was most sittings. The most a failed A2 supports is A1, and saying
 * so is the honest end of a section that never set an A1 question.
 *
 * **And a near miss confirmed by the band above it is a pass.** The session
 * asks one band past a failure for exactly one reason, written on
 * `ladderStopped`: a learner who came in just under two thirds and then does
 * the next band comfortably was having a bad six questions, and that is worth
 * finding out. This function never learned that rule. It asked the question
 * and threw the answer away: a real sitting came back writing A2 at 53% and B1
 * at 73%, was scored A1 for writing, and read A2 overall with B1 in the other
 * two skills, on a screen that printed the B1 pass beside it. Six typed
 * questions with partial credit is a band where one answer is the difference
 * between 53 and 67, and the band above is the second opinion the paper went
 * to the trouble of collecting.
 *
 * So a band between `FLOOR` and `PASS` counts as passed when the next band
 * asked clears `PASS`, and the climb goes on from there. A band under `FLOOR`
 * still ends it, whatever sits above, because under half is not a near miss
 * and the session asks nothing above it anyway; and a near miss with a near
 * miss above it is two bands not passed, not one confirmed. Measured with
 * `npm run measure:placement`, 2,000 simulated learners a level over the
 * real ladder: B1 placed at its own level went from 73% to 78%, B2 from 66%
 * to 79% and C1 from 52% to 69%, which is the direction the old rule was
 * wrong in; pre-A1 gave up two points and "placed above" rose by one to
 * three, which is the price of reading a confirmed near miss as the pass it
 * probably was.
 *
 * RE-RUN ON 2026-09-05 AND IT REPRODUCES, which is the only thing that makes
 * the three figures above worth having written down. The whole table, 2,000
 * learners a level: pre-A1 72%, A1 87%, A2 82%, B1 78%, B2 79%, C1 69% placed
 * at their own level, with the rest below at every band but pre-A1, where 28%
 * are placed above because there is nothing below to place them at.
 *
 * These are **not** the 97, 98, 93, 85, 80 and 72 that `docs/03-architecture.md`
 * quotes for the same paper. That set came from a simulation that lived in a
 * pull request, with a more generous learner behind it; this script says in
 * its own header that its model is its own and its figures compare with each
 * other rather than with those. Two instruments, one paper, and the numbers
 * only mean anything beside the ones from the same instrument.

 * through the floor and the floor was the whole rule. Nobody who reads and
 * writes at B2 is below A1. The number was not a cautious reading of that
