/**
 * How long this is actually going to take, and what it takes to get there.
 *
 * A learning app that answers "how long until I speak Estonian" with a streak
 * counter is answering a different question than the one asked, and the honest
 * answer is measured in hundreds of hours. This module says so. What it does
 * not do any more is read that number pessimistically. The first verdicts were
 * drawn at the far end of every range against the least a week could hold, so
 * a B1 speaker with a year, living in Estonia and working in Estonian, read
 * "it fits, but only with study outside this app" over a tile saying the app
 * alone would take five hundred weeks. Both were true and neither was the
 * answer, which is that B2 in a year is about five hours a week of Estonian,
 * and somebody who has decided to do it will. The plan now assumes the person
 * in front of it means it: the distance is quoted honestly, the verdict is
 * drawn at the near end of it, and what it asks for is a number of hours a
 * week to commit to rather than a reason it will not work.
 *
 * Unflattering is not the same as one number for everybody, and for a while it
 * was. The plan quoted one table, assumed the same five found hours a week of
 * somebody in Tartu with an Estonian partner and somebody in Leeds with a
 * textbook, built on a level a learner had guessed in ninety seconds as though
 * a paper had measured it, and never once read the review log its own header
 * promised it would. So a B1 speaker was told B2 was as far off as a stranger
 * would find it, and a beginner living inside the language was told to go and
 * find a class. Every figure now says which of four things it rests on:
 *
 *   - the **published hours** between two levels, with the Estonian surcharge
 *     put where the difficulty actually is rather than spread evenly;
 *   - where the learner **stands**, measured skill by skill where a check was
 *     sat and widened where the level is their own guess;
 *   - what their **week already holds**, read off the reasons they gave;
 *   - and their **own pace**, off the review log, once there is one to read.
 *
 * Nothing here is measured on this app's learners as a population, and the
 * copy says that too. What is measured is the one learner in front of it.
 *
 * Pure arithmetic and constants. No React, no database.

 * How much harder each step is in Estonian than in the language those hours

 * The scale comes from the US Foreign Service Institute, which groups Estonian

 * professional working proficiency against about 600 for French or Spanish.
 * The first version of this table applied that ratio evenly, near double at
 * every band, and that is not where the difficulty lives. What makes Estonian
 * slow is the morphology: fourteen cases, consonant gradation, the partial
 * object, and all of it has to be in place before anybody holds a
 * conversation. That is the A2 and B1 stretch. A1 is greetings, numbers and
 * the shop in any language, and it is only a little dearer here; and the step
 * from B1 to B2 is mostly vocabulary, register and reading stamina, which
 * cost about what they cost in French once the grammar underneath them works.
 * C1 is long everywhere, and Estonian's long tail of derivation and idiom is
 * genuinely longer, so the surcharge climbs again at the top.
 *
 * So the factor peaks at B1 and dips at B2, and the shape is asserted rather
 * than remembered. It is a judgment over published figures, stated as one;
 * nothing published gives the ratio band by band. The whole climb still lands
 * within the FSI ratio, which is what keeps it a reading of that source and
