 * Which case each question word Ekilex writes a government as signals.
 *
 * READ OFF `CASES`, NOT TYPED, because the typed version was missing three.
 * Essive, terminative and abessive had no row, so `caseOf` returned null for
 * `kellena`, `kelleni` and `kelleta`, `formatGovernment` left them unannotated
 * and `parseGovernment` could then read no case out of the entry at all.
 * `töötama kellena`, which is how you say what you do for a living, had no
 * government card; and `esitama` and `käsitama` govern the essive beside the
 * partitive, so the drill could offer it as a wrong answer and mark a learner
 * wrong for knowing it. That is the exact fault `alsoGoverned` exists to
 * prevent, arriving through a gap in a table rather than through the parser.
 *
 * `lib/estonian/cases.ts` already holds the question a case answers, which is
 * the `mille-` word, so nothing here is written down twice. The `kelle-` form
 * is the same word for the other interrogative pronoun: `mis` and `kes`
 * decline alike in every oblique case, which `npm run audit:cases` confirms
 * against the Institute for both of them. So one substitution, on an attested
 * word, rather than an ending joined to a stem.
 *
 * The three adverbial questions are named as what they are. Ekilex writes
 * `kus`, `kuhu` and `kust` where a verb takes a place rather than a case, and
 * each covers several: naming one would be inventing a government, so they are
 * annotated for a reader and left unparseable, which is `parseGovernment`
 * returning null and the drill skipping the verb.

    A PRINCIPAL PART IS ONE FORM, AND EKILEX OFTEN GIVES TWO.

    deliberately, because Estonian has genuine parallel forms (`raamatutes`
    beside `raamatuis`) and a key without it would drop one. That is right for
    the whole retrieved table and it is wrong for the six principal parts,
    which are the forms a learner memorizes: 2,016 of the 5,363 shipped entries
    carried two `PART_PL` rows and 120 carried two `GEN_PL`, and which of the
    pair the app used was decided by whoever read them. `stemsFrom` takes the
    first row it finds, in whatever order the database returns; every caller
    that builds a `Record` with `Object.fromEntries` takes the last. So the
    dictionary entry for `aadress` could show `aadresse` while the flashcard
    behind it asked for `aadressisid`, and neither was a decision anybody made.

    Ekilex lists the primary first, which is the one a course teaches: `asju`
    before `asjasid`, `aegu` before `aegasid`, `rindade` before `rinde`. So the
    first wins for a principal part. The parallel form is not lost where it

 * question is a wrong one:
 *
 *   `keda/mida*`        both alternatives are partitive, so partitive.
 *   `millest/kellest`   both elative, so elative.

 *                       the verb. A different phenomenon, so it is left alone.
 *   `mida tegemast`     an infinitive complement, not a case. Left alone.
 *   `kellel + mida teha`  two complements at once. Left alone.

 * question words that all agree, names a case. Anything with another word in
