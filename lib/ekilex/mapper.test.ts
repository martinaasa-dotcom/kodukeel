  The mapper is where an outside dictionary becomes this app's data, and it had
  no tests. The government half of it was quietly dropping most of what Ekilex
  sends: it looked each pattern up whole, and Ekilex almost never writes a bare
  one. `tänama` arrives as "keda/mida*" and `hoolima` as "millest/kellest",
  neither of which is a key, so the case went unnamed and the drill discarded
  the verb. Verb government therefore stayed at the twenty-five entries somebody
  had typed by hand, next to a source that knows thousands, and nothing failed
  to say so.

  Every pattern below was taken from a real Ekilex response.
