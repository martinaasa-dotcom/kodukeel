/**
 * SÕNAD: SIX CIRCLES, SEVEN GUESSES, AND AN ESTONIAN WORD BEHIND THEM.
 *
 * The shape is the one everybody knows, and everything about it that somebody
 * else can own has been left alone deliberately rather than by accident. The
 * New York Times owns the name Wordle and the look of it, and has enforced
 * both. What it does not own, and could not, is the idea of guessing a word and
 * being told which letters were right: that is older than computers, since
 * Mastermind sold it in 1970 and Bulls and Cows was a pencil game before that.
 *
 * So: a different name, a different length, circles rather than squares, this
 * app's own three hues rather than green and yellow and gray, its own
 * animations, no line of anybody else's code and no shared word list.
 *
 * SIX LETTERS, WHICH IS A FACT ABOUT ESTONIAN AND ABOUT THIS DICTIONARY. Five
 * is the length the English game uses and it is the wrong one here twice over.
 * Estonian words are longer, and the graded dictionary this draws from holds
 * 450 five-letter content words against 603 at six, which after banding to a
 * learner's own level is 183 answers against 215 at A1, and 352 against 477 at
 * B1. Six is the bigger pool, the better game, and visibly not the other one.
 * Four was the alternative the brief offered: it has the biggest pool of all at
 * 816, and a four-letter word is guessed by accident.
 *
 * SEVEN GUESSES FOR SIX LETTERS. The English game gives six for five. Six for
 * six is the same ratio and it is not the same game: Estonian has nine vowels
 * where English is usually deducing among five, so a guesser who has placed
 * the consonants can still be choosing between `koolis`, `kuulis` and `küliss`
 * on the last row. The seventh is that one extra elimination.
 *
 * AND TWO CLUES, ON A LADDER, BECAUSE A CLUE THAT ARRIVES AT THE START IS PART
 * OF THE QUESTION. What kind of thing the word is comes on the fourth try,
 * which is the point at which somebody has stopped deducing and started
 * guessing; how many vowels it has comes on the last, where it is the
 * difference between finishing and being told. Both come out of the
 * dictionary: the category is Ekilex's own classification read through
 * `semanticCategory`, and the vowel count is arithmetic over the answer.
 * Nothing here is written about a word.
 *
 * Pure: strings in, marks out. Which word today is, and whether a guess is a
 * word at all, are database questions and live in `lib/progress/sonad.ts`.

 * Which letters were right, in the only way that handles a repeated letter.

 * wrong: both come back as near misses, which tells somebody something untrue
 * about a word they are deducing. So the exact hits are taken first and what is
 * left of the answer is a pool the misplaced ones draw from, one each.
 *
 * Case-folded, because a learner types what their keyboard gives them and the
 * answer is a dictionary headword. **Not** diacritic-folded: ö and o are
 * different letters, the difference is most of what makes spelling Estonian
 * hard, and a game that forgave it would be teaching the mistake.

 * which is the ceiling a hint that narrows sets everywhere else in this app
 * (`lib/questions/hints.ts`), and a loss is `Again`.

 * rows. It used to be a count, and the comment above it said the fifth guess
 * on was `Again` while the code said `Hard`, and the fourth guess, which is
 * typed with the category already printed beside the board, was graded `Good`
