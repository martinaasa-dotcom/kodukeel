/**
 * THE ROUND THAT DRILLS THE WORDS THE PATTERN DOES NOT REACH.
 *
 * `/grammar/exceptions` is the list; this is what to do with it, which is the
 * same split `/dictionary/common` and `/review/common` already make. Reading a
 * list of unpredictable forms teaches nobody one.
 *
 * THREE RUNGS, AND THEY ARE THE LADDER `lib/learn/ladder.ts` ALREADY ARGUES FOR
 * rather than a second progression: meet it, produce it, use it. A learner is
 * shown the form and what it departs from, then asked to type it cold, then
 * asked for it inside a sentence a lexicographer wrote. The last rung is where
 * the form stops being a fact and becomes a word, and it is offered only where
 * the dictionary holds a sentence carrying that very form: a gap this app made
 * up would be this app writing Estonian (ADR-005), and a rung that is sometimes
 * absent is better than one that is sometimes invented.
 *
 * A PASS AT A TIME, so the rungs space themselves. Every word is met, then
 * every word is produced, then every word is used, which puts the gap between
 * meeting a form and being asked for it at the size of the round rather than at
 * one card. That is `requeue`'s argument in `lib/srs/queue.ts` and the reason
 * the learn ladder waits five words: an answer given four seconds after the
 * answer was shown is reading, not retrieval.
 *
 * MEETING WRITES NOTHING. A card you have never seen cannot be recalled, only
 * met, so the first rung grades nothing at all, exactly as the first sight of a
 * word in review does. What the other two write goes through `gradeCard` like
 * every other mode (ADR-016), carrying the slot that was actually asked, so the
 * illative somebody cannot produce here lands in the same weakest-case chart as
 * the illative they cannot produce on a card.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock. What word to ask about is a database
 * question and it is the page's.
