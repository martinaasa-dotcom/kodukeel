/**
 * FLASH CARDS: THE WORDS YOU HAVE MET, ASKED IN A WAY REVIEW DOES NOT ASK THEM.
 *
 * The round used to render `ReviewSession` over the learner's own cards, which
 * is the same four shapes review already uses: turn a card over, pick one of
 * four, fill a gap, type a form. The learner's report was that it "reverts back
 * to what is in the Review section", and they were right, because it was
 * review, drawn from a different queue. What was asked for instead is a word
 * already met "used in other ways too", including writing a sentence of your
 * own and hearing one and producing the form out of it, across "a huge variety
 * of case endings and grammar", until the app can be confident the word is
 * known.
 *
 * FIVE SHAPES, AND THE POOL WIDENS AS THE WORD SETTLES.
 *
 *   `recall`   English to Estonian, typed. The plainest, and the only shape a
 *              word with no forms to inflect can be asked in at all.
 *   `inflect`  The word and the question a case answers, typed. No options:
 *              producing `toas` is a different memory from picking it out of
 *              four, and picking is what stops telling you anything about a
 *              word that is nearly known.
 *   `gap`      An attested sentence with the form taken out, typed, with the
 *              meaning rather than the lemma beside it, so the sentence is
 *              what tells you which form is wanted.
 *   `heard`    The same sentence spoken and never shown. Type the form you
 *              heard. This is the one shape where the context arrives through
 *              the ear, which is where a case ending is hardest to catch, and
 *              the sentence is revealed afterwards with the form marked in it.
 *   `build`    Write your own sentence putting the word in a named form. The
 *              form is marked by string comparison against what the dictionary
 *              vouches for, never by a model (ADR-005), and where the learner
 *              reached for another form of the same word it is named.
 *
 * `shapeFor` widens the pool as the learner gets the word right: the first ask
 * is the plainest shape available and each correct answer opens the next one,
 * so `tuba` starts at the gap in `Ma olen ____.` and ends at "write me a
 * sentence with it". A word never gets harder than the dictionary can support:
 * a sentence shape needs an attested sentence carrying that very form, and
 * where there is none the pool simply holds fewer shapes.
 *
 * THE SENTENCE IS THE PLAINEST ASK, NOT THE HARDEST, and the first version had
 * that backwards. It opened every word on `inflect`, the word and the question
 * a case answers, and only the second correct answer reached the gap. A
 * learner drove it and said the ask was still not specific enough: `kohtuma`
 * over "How do you say this about somebody else, already happened?" is a
 * clause describing a form, and what they wanted was the sentence that needs
 * it, `Ta ____ eile sõbraga`, so that the reason for the ending is on the
 * screen and not in a grammar book. That is the rule the deck already keeps
 * (a case is drilled in a sentence that uses it, or it is not drilled), and a
 * round built on the same log has no argument for being looser. So where the
 * dictionary holds a sentence carrying the form, the pool is `gap`, `heard`,
 * `build` and `inflect` is not in it: a bare ask on a word the app can show
 * in use is the less effective question, and there is no step at which it
 * becomes the better one. `inflect` survives only where no lexicographer has
 * recorded the form, since the alternative there is not asking the form at
 * all, and the page prefers a slot with a sentence behind it over one
 * without. Every form of the ask is still marked against what the dictionary
 * holds, and nothing is written (ADR-005).
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS WRITTEN AND NOTHING IS GENERATED. Every Estonian character in
 * a task came out of Ekilex or off the app's own derivation from a stored stem,
 * which is the same latitude the cards, the grammar pages and the gap-fill
 * already take (ADR-005 amendment 1), and every task says which. Every mark is
 * a string comparison against a form the dictionary holds.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock. The rows come from the page.

 * the lemma nor the Estonian it holds. The mark carries no answer of its own
 * here either, since `checkAnswer` already strips punctuation before
 * comparing, so typing it was never required. What it did was print on the
 * card, on the reveal, on the star label and in the round's mastery meter,
 * which reads as the app shouting the word rather than teaching it.
 *
 * Applied inside `askableSlots` and `flashTask`, the two places a word's
 * lemma becomes something a screen shows, rather than at each caller: this
 * module has two of those (the flash round and `audit:questions`, which
 * builds the same tasks to check what a screen shows), and a strip left to
 * the caller is a strip the second one would forget. Trailing only, and only
 * `!`, so a sentence a learner writes and a question mark a phrase genuinely
