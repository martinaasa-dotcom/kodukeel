/**
 * WHAT A CROSSWORD CLUE IS, AND WHICH WORD IT IS ALLOWED TO BE ABOUT.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES A CLUE. The clue is the English gloss already beside the
 * entry, cut to its first sense or two, with the kind of word named. A model
 * writing crossword clues would be a model writing about Estonian a learner
 * then acts on, and this app has one answer to that (ADR-005). Every rule
 * below only ever *refuses* a clue or labels it; none of them writes English.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT THREE LINES IN THE COMPILER. A learner reported
 * `3 down: human`, typed `inimene`, which is what a human is, watched it fit
 * the seven squares, and was marked wrong: the answer was `inimlik`, the
 * adjective. Nothing about that clue was false. `inimlik` is glossed "human"
 * and `inimene` is glossed "human being", and the two are different entries
 * with different parts of speech, so no check the app had could see it. What
 * the learner had in front of them was one English word that is a noun and an
 * adjective in English, over a row of the right length for both.
 *
 * A gap-fill or a flashcard can widen its answer instead, which is what
 * `acceptedAnswers` does for a word with two right spellings. A crossword
 * cannot: the grid is a fixed number of squares crossing other words, so
 * exactly one string can go in it, and a clue with two honest answers is a
 * trick rather than a question. So the clue narrows until it has one.
 *
 * TWO RULES, AND THEY CATCH DIFFERENT THINGS.
 *
 * A CLUE SAYS WHAT KIND OF WORD IT WANTS. English does not mark a part of
 * speech and Estonian derivation does: "human" is a noun and an adjective in
 * English and is two words here, and so is "clean", "light" and "empty".
 * `human · adjective` is `inimlik` and nothing else, and it costs one word of
 * the line. It is the hint a production card has carried since the deck was
 * built (`lib/srs/cards.ts` sets `hint: lex.pos.toLowerCase()`), on the one
 * screen that had never printed it. Measured over the shipped dictionary it
 * separates the pair above and six other clue lines outright.
 *
 * AND NO OTHER ENTRY ANSWERS IT. Naming the kind is not enough on its own,
 * because 92 clue lines in the shipped dictionary are the same line over the
 * same part of speech: `kena` and `ilus` are both "beautiful", and whichever
 * of them the grid wants, the other is a correct answer to the clue printed
 * above it. `clueClashes` finds them and both are refused, which is the rule
 * `senses.ts` reaches for a production card pointed at a screen that cannot
 * widen. Read over the **whole** dictionary rather than the day's band, and
 * that is the half that would have caught the report if the parts of speech
 * had matched: `inimene` is A1 and the grid was B1, so the rival was never in
 * the pool and a check against the pool would have passed.
 *
 * A SENSE SET RATHER THAN A STRING, because a clue is a list. "a friend" and
 * "a friend, a mate" are two different strings and one of them is every word
 * the other one is: everything the shorter clue says is true of both entries,
 * so it has two answers. Comparing the strings finds 319 refusals of the 2,290
 * words the pool can draw on and comparing the sets finds 665, which is 29% of
 * the pool and the reason this is worth measuring rather than reasoning about.
 * What is left is 271 words at A1 and 511 at B1, against a grid that wants
 * seven, so the cost is a word the compiler was never going to reach.
 *
 * Pure: entries in, strings out. Which entries is a database question and
 * lives in `lib/progress/crossword.ts`.
 */

/**
 * A clue is one line. A gloss like "a devil, an evil spirit, the deuce" is
 * three, and a crossword clue that is longer than the grid is a paragraph with
 * a box under it. Measured on the gloss rather than on the finished line, so
 * naming the kind of word does not silently drop the longest clues.
