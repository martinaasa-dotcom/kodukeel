/**
 * MARKING ONE SENTENCE ABOUT A SCENE.
 *
 * The scene is three things and a situation (`lib/collections/scenes.ts`); the
 * learner writes one Estonian sentence about it; this decides what can be
 * decided without a model.
 *
 * WHAT IS CERTAIN AND WHAT IS AN OPINION, which is the split `/api/write`
 * already draws and the reason this module holds no provider. Certain: whether
 * the sentence used each of the three words, whether the named one carried the
 * case the task asked for, and **which case it carried instead**. Every one of
 * those is a comparison against a form the dictionary vouches for. An opinion:
 * whether the sentence is idiomatic, which is Anu's and is labeled as hers.
 *
 * THE THIRD ONE IS THE POINT OF THE MODE. "You did not use the form we asked
 * for" is the least useful true thing this app can say, and it is what every
 * other screen says: they compare against one form and stop. A learner asked
 * for `majas` who wrote `majast` has made one specific mistake and can be told
 * so in a line, which is what `lib/estonian/whichCase.ts` is for.
 *
 * THREE RATINGS RATHER THAN TWO. The writing mode grades Good or Again,
 * because a form is either the one asked for or it is not. Here the middle
 * case is real and the app can tell it apart with certainty: using the word and
 * choosing the wrong ending is a Hard, not an Again, and the scheduler should
 * see the difference. Nothing about `RATINGS` or the scheduler changes; this
 * only decides which of the four to send (ADR-016).
 *
 * Pure. `lib/exam/written.ts` is where "did they use this word" already lives
 * and it is pure throughout, which is asserted rather than assumed, because a
 * second copy of that answer is a marker and a screen disagreeing about
 * whether `koertega` is `koer`.

    tasks the sixty scenes can set were free, and `markDescription` graded the
    copied word Good and sent it to the scheduler.

    The caller walks the cases in priority order and takes the first that
