/**
 * WHICH FACET OF A WORD ONE ANSWER WAS ABOUT.
 *
 * `Review.targetCase` answers this for a case card and nothing else, and that
 * turned out to be most of why nothing was ever mastered. `lib/srs/mastery.ts`
 * counts distinct slots as the variety half of its claim, reading
 * `targetCase ?? ""`, so every answer that was not about a case landed in one
 * shared slot:
 *
 *   - A verb has no case cards at all, because `CASE_FORM` needs a genitive
 *     stem. Its recognition, production, gap-fill and eight conjugation cards
 *     were one slot between them, so no verb in any deck could ever reach the
 *     three the rule asks for. Not one of the 799 in the shipped dictionary.
 *   - A word added from the dictionary gets recognition, production and a
 *     gap-fill by default (`CARD_TYPES`), so it had two slots at best and
 *     usually one.
 *
 * A rule nothing can satisfy is not a high standard, it is a broken counter,
 * and the round built on top of it draws the words that are *not* mastered, so
 * the two faults compound: the flash round kept asking about words it would
 * never let go of.
 *
 * So a slot is the specific thing that was asked, and `Review.slot` records it.
 * A case where there is one, the conjugation form where the answer was a named
 * part of a verb, and the card's own type otherwise, because "what does this
 * word mean" and "how do you say it" are two different questions about one word
 * and always were.
 *
 * WHY NOT WIDEN `targetCase`. It is read by `caseAccuracy`, which tallies
 * whatever string it finds and hands it to `WeakestCases`, which falls back to
 * printing the key in lower case. Writing `IndPrSg3` into that column puts
 * `indprsg3` on the Progress page beside `osastav`. The two columns answer two
 * questions: `targetCase` is for the case charts and is unchanged, `slot` is
 * for "have you met this word in enough ways", and neither has to be bent to
 * be the other.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no Prisma, no Estonian: a slot is a key, and `slotLabel`
 * reads the names out of `CASES` and the table below, which holds morph codes
 * and the labels a class uses, exactly as `lib/srs/cards.ts` did when it owned
 * this table.
 */

/**
 * The named parts of the verb a card can ask for, with the Ekilex morph code
 * that identifies each one.
 *
 * It lives here rather than in `lib/srs/cards.ts` because it is now read by
 * two things that must not disagree: the card builder, and whatever decides
 * what a verb answer was about. The labels are the four axes a course keeps
 * apart, which is the naming rule the whole app follows.
