  THE PRODUCTION CARD THAT USED TO MARK A RIGHT ANSWER WRONG.

  Front is the gloss, hint is the part of speech, back is the lemma, and
  `checkAnswer` marks against the back. So two entries with one gloss and one
  part of speech were one question with two right answers, each card marking
  the other's answer wrong: the dictionary ships 372 such prompts, `ja` and
  `ning` both glossed "and" among them.

  These assert the whole path rather than the join, because the join is only
  right if `acceptedAnswers` splits it back out: that is what makes what the
  screen shows and what the marker takes the same string, and it is the reason
  the separator is the one it is.
