/**
 * The deck builder, against the database, because the thing that was wrong with
 * it could only be wrong against a database.
 *
 * `addUnitsToDeck` reads the cards a learner already holds, filters the
 * generated ones against them and inserts the rest. That is check-then-act, and
 * the gap between the read and the insert is a whole unit's worth of card
 * building: two requests inside it both see the same deck and both insert. The
 * per-word path it replaced took an advisory lock for exactly this reason, and
 * the batched rewrite did not inherit one, which moved the fault from one word
 * to a unit at a time.
 *
 * Measured before the lock went back: eight concurrent adds of an eighteen-word
 * unit wrote 180 cards where 36 is right. A learner meets it by double-tapping
 * "Add to deck", or the last button of first run, which is the one screen where
 * somebody is already waiting and inclined to press again.
 *
 * So these run concurrently on purpose. No unit test can see this, because the
 * fault is entirely in what two connections do at once.
 *
 * It reads the shipped dictionary and writes nothing but its own cards. That is
 * deliberate: a fixture that wrote the unit's lemmas would be writing rows
 * beside the seeded ones, since `@@unique` is on `(lemma, pos)`, and the
 * builder's whole job is to turn the real dictionary into a real deck.
