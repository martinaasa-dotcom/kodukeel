/**
 * Writing one grade down.
 *
 * ONE ANSWER TO ONE QUESTION, WHICH IT WAS NOT.
 *
 * A grade arrives by two doors: `gradeCard` when the connection is up, and
 * `applyGradeBatch` when a device comes back. Both wrote the Review row and
 * then the card's new scheduling, and the two copies had drifted on the one
 * thing that is actually hard about this, which moment the grade is recorded
 * at.
 *
 * `gradeCard` floors it at the card's own creation, with a comment saying why:
 * a review dated before the card existed is a review of something that was not
 * there, and the streak, the heatmap and every "reviews this week" figure read
 * that column and cannot tell a replayed grade from a forged one. The replay
 * path had no such floor, and it is the path that carries a device's own
 * timestamps, so the fix was written on the door nobody was coming through.
 *
 * `Review` is append-only, so a bad row is permanent. That is the whole reason
 * this is one function rather than two that agree today.
 *
 * Kept out of `app/actions.ts` so it can be exercised against a real database
 * without a session, the same shape `applyGradeBatch` already takes: the owner
 * is a parameter here precisely because this module is not a public endpoint.
 */

/**
 * The moment a grade is recorded at.
 *
 * A device's clock is whatever its owner set it to, so the answer is bounded at
 * both ends: never after now, and never before the card it is about existed.
 * An unparseable date is treated as now rather than rejected, because the
 * learner did do the review and losing it to a wrong clock is the worse
 * outcome.

/**
 * A `Review` row off a backup file, bounded the way `writeGrade` bounds one.

 * EVERY OTHER DOOR INTO THIS TABLE IS GUARDED AND THIS ONE WAS NOT.
 *

 * in: the moment, which `reviewMoment` refuses to book into the future; the
 * duration, capped at ten minutes so a tab left open at lunch cannot carry
 * half an hour into a median; the slot, checked against the closed list in
 * `lib/srs/slots.ts` because the value arrives from a browser; and the reached
 * slot, narrower still. `restoreBackup` wrote none of that. It took
 * `reviewedAt`, `rating`, `durationMs`, `slot` and `reachedSlot` exactly as
 * the file spelled them, into the one table this app never repairs.
 *
 * The file is a document somebody hands the server, which is the argument that
 * already hardened the `Lexeme` half of the same restore. The realistic way it
 * goes wrong is not malice: it is a device with a wrong clock, or a file
 * somebody opened and edited. A single review dated next week is enough to
 * read as a day nobody has lived through yet, and `Review` is append-only, so
 * there is no path in this app that could ever take it out again.
 *
 * Two bounds are deliberately looser here than in `writeGrade`. The moment is
 * not floored at the card's creation, because a backup carries reviews of
 * cards that were deleted and `Review` has no relation to `Card` on purpose.
 * And the slot is passed through the closed list rather than replaced by the
 * card's own, since there may be no card to ask.
 *
 * Returns null for a row this app could not have written, which is a rating
 * outside the four the scheduler knows. Dropping one row is the right cost:
 * the alternative is a grade nothing can read sitting in the history for ever.
