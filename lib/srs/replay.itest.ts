 * ago on 2026-09-19. `clampReviewedAt` floors a device timestamp at
 * `MAX_BACKDATE_DAYS` before the moment the batch is applied, so on that day
 * the replay below asked for 09:00 and read back `now` minus thirty days, and
 * the ordering test was one more day from clamping both of its grades onto the
