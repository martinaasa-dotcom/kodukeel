          This asked `ravim → millesse? kuhu?` and took `ravimisse`, and a
          learner reported it as pointless. They were right, and the fault was
          not the wording. The card was generated from the fact that the
          morphology *permits* the form: `caseFits` asks whether the word is a
          person, `caseAnswer` asks whether a form can be built, and where both
          said yes a card existed. Nothing ever asked whether anybody says it.
          That built 23,106 case cards over 4,664 words, about five each, and
          the dictionary could show a sentence for 1,494 of them. `ravim` had
          none: no lexicographer has ever recorded a medicine being gone into,
          and the card was asking a learner to attach `sse` to a stem and
          calling it Estonian.

          A form nobody can be shown using is a form this app cannot teach. So
          the sentence is the card now, and a case with no sentence behind it
          builds nothing, which takes the deck to 996 cards over 914 words. The
          learner produces `ravimisse` because a sentence needs it, rather than
          because a label demanded it, which is the only reason anybody ever
          produces a case.

          THE SENTENCE HAS TO NAME THE CASE ON ITS OWN, TOO. `aadressi` is the
          short illative, the omastav and the osastav all at once, so gapping
          it out of a sentence where it is a genitive and labeling the card
          `sisseütlev` would teach the wrong case and write the wrong one into
          `Review.slot`, which is what `caseAccuracy` and the weakest-case
          panel are built from. `readCase` is the strict rule that already
          exists for this and it is the one read here: exactly one case, or no
          card. That is what takes 1,494 to 996, and the 498 it refuses are the
          ones nothing could have told apart.

          What this is not is a second `CLOZE`. A cloze gaps whatever form the
          sentence happens to hold; this picks the sentence *for* a case and
          carries `targetCase`, which is the column every case figure in the
          app is derived from.

          A PERSON OF A VERB IS DRILLED IN A SENTENCE THAT USES IT, OR IT IS NOT

          `lugema → olevik · ta` asked for a suffix on a stem and nothing about
          it said why anybody would say `loeb`. That was 4,747 cards over 679
          verbs in the shipped dictionary, and a sentence a lexicographer wrote
          holding that very form exists for 421 of them, 252 of those the third
          person, which is the form most sentences are in.

          The negative and the singular imperative are one spelling: `loe` is
          both `ei loe` and `loe!`, and a spelling two slots claim is named by
          neither, exactly as `readCase` refuses `kohvi`. Here the sentence
          itself settles it, though, because the `ei` is in the sentence: `Ma
          ei loe` is the negative and `Loe!` is the imperative, and a
          lexicographer wrote both words. So the negative gaps `ei loe` whole,
          which is what the card's back has always been and what `eitus · ma
          ei` asks for, and the imperative refuses a token with `ei` in front
          of it. That is 232 more cards the pair alone had been hiding.

          The cue never names the slot. `olevik · ta` beside `lugema` is `loeb`
          written out in two pieces, the way `sisseütlev` beside `ravim` is
          `ravimisse`; the slot travels on `Card.slot`, where the reveal and
          the mastery reading read it.

          headword is sometimes lexicography rather than something somebody
          said, and `usableExamples` keeps what is worth printing on a

          of these up; the deck never did, and built 95 gap-fill cards out of

          9) ____;` is an ordinance. `Ta kannab tumedaid ____/teksasid.` leaves
          the answer standing beside the gap in its other spelling, which is
          the worst of them: the card cannot be got wrong and cannot be got
          right either.

          The opener is this word's own, which is all a card builder needs to
          know: the label pattern is a usage that names its own headword and
          then illustrates a sense the gloss beside it does not, and the
          headword here is the word the card is for.

            the dictionary form, the hint printed it a line under the gap, so
            the exercise this comment describes was not the exercise on screen.
            Dropping the card would lose a real question, since "which word goes
            in this gap, given what it means" is worth asking; what it may not
            do is hand over the string.

            So the hint falls back rather than switching: the lemma and the
            meaning, then the meaning alone, then nothing. The last step is not
            hypothetical, because a word can be spelled the same in both
