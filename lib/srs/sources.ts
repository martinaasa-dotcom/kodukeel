/**
 * WHERE A CARD CAME FROM, AND WHICH OF THOSE ARE THE LEARNER'S OWN.
 *
 * `Card.source` has been written on every deck add since the scheduler was
 * built and read by one thing: `wordOfDay` counting the words kept off the
 * almanac card. It was a label nobody looked at, so nothing noticed that two
 * of its values had come to mean the same thing.
 *
 * `addUnitsToDeck` defaulted its source to `DICTIONARY`, as the button on a
 * dictionary entry still does. So a word a learner went and looked up because
 * they were curious, and every word of a course unit they added in one press,
 * were filed identically. It defaults to `COURSE` now, which is what the
 * column was widened for; the sentence is kept in the past tense rather than
 * deleted because it is the reason the column has more than two values. That is the column answering "which table did this come
 * out of" when the question worth asking is "whose idea was this word".
 *
 * The distinction matters because of what the review queue does with a new
 * card. Unseen cards are read oldest first, sixty at a time, and ordered by
 * band; a word looked up this afternoon therefore sits behind the whole course
 * backlog and may not be reached for months. That is the right default for a
 * course and the wrong one for the word somebody stopped and looked up on the
 * bus, which is exactly the word they were interested in. `/review/lookups` is
 * where those get asked, and this is the list it reads.
 *
 * THREE KINDS, AND THE THIRD IS THE HONEST ONE.
 *
 * `COURSE`, `FREQUENCY` and `SCENE` are material this app chose: a unit, one of
 * the four commonest-word lists, a situation. `LOOKUP`, `MANUAL`, `TUTOR`,
 * `IMPORT`, `SCAN`, `ALMANAC` and `SENTENCE` are words the learner went and
 * got, one at a time, off an entry, a photograph, a pasted list, Anu, the word
 * of the day, or a word they hit inside the sentence a card was teaching with.
 *
 * `DICTIONARY` is neither and is claimed by nothing. Every card written before
 * this carries it, and a card written before this really could be either, so
 * reading it as a lookup would fill the round with course words for every
 * learner who already has a deck and reading it as course material would hide
 * the lookups they already have. There is no third reading and no repair: the
 * column records what was written down, and what was written down did not tell
 * the two apart. It stops being written today and the round fills from today.
 * Silence is never evidence, and the safe direction is to claim less.
 *
 * Pure, and a closed list, because `addToDeck` is a `"use server"` export and
 * therefore a public endpoint: `source` arrives as JSON off the wire whatever
 * the type says, and one caller filing a card under a value nothing writes
 * would quietly break a count this app presents as derived.

 * the same way a unit is. `DICTIONARY` is absent for the reason in the header.
 *
 * `SENTENCE` is present, and the sentence being the app's choice is not the
 * question. A first meeting shows an attested sentence and the dictionary
 * under every word in it; the learner reads the line, hits one word they do
 * not have, and presses a button about that word. That is the same act as
 * keeping the word of the day, which the app also chose and which is on this

 * before the column was split really could be either and claiming it would
 * fill that round with course words. This answers "may the module hold this
 * word back until it has taught it", and there the same silence points the
 * other way: withholding a word somebody looked up, because a column written
 * years ago cannot say whose idea it was, is the gate deciding something
 * nobody asked it to. So the three this app demonstrably chose are named, and
 * everything else, `DICTIONARY` included, is the learner's until it says

 * Claim less, in the direction that costs least. There it was a round left
