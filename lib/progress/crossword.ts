/**
 * WHICH WORDS TODAY'S CROSSWORD IS MADE OF.
 *
 * The pool is the graded dictionary at the learner's own level, three to seven
 * letters, with a gloss short enough to be a clue. `lib/games/crossword.ts`
 * compiles it, and it compiles the pool in the order it is handed, so the day
 * decides which words are tried first and a reload returns the same grid.
 *
 * A SEEDED SHUFFLE RATHER THAN A SKIP, because a crossword needs a *set* of
 * words rather than one, and a window into an alphabetical list gives seven
 * words beginning with the same letter, which cross badly and read worse. The
 * generator is `lib/random/shuffle.ts`'s, with the day as its seed, which is
 * the same arrangement `lib/exam/paper.ts` has and for the same reason: the
 * server has to be able to rebuild the puzzle to mark it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES A CLUE. The clue is the English gloss already beside the
 * word, trimmed to its first sense or two, with the kind of word named. A
 * model writing crossword clues would be a model writing about Estonian words
 * a learner then acts on, and this app has one answer to that (ADR-005).
 *
 * AND A CLUE THIS DICTIONARY HAS TWO ANSWERS TO IS NOT SET. `lib/games/clue.ts`
 * holds both halves of that rule and the report that produced it; what this
 * file adds is the reading it is done against, which is the **whole**
 * dictionary rather than the day's band. The word that made `3 down: human`
 * unanswerable was A1 and the grid was B1, so a clash read off the pool would
 * have found nothing to complain about.

    written out here on the argument that "a shared one would be shared state",

    different sequence, because it pre-adds the constant. `recordCrossword`
    rebuilds the day's grid from the date to mark it, the way `submitExam`
    rebuilds a paper (ADR-022), so swapping the stream would mark somebody
