 * The learner's readiness for every situation the course promises, read off

 * Nothing is stored (ADR-014). Every reading is derived on the request from
 * the append-only review log, the learner's cases over the shared half-year
 * window, the most recent level check and the mock papers they have sat.
 * Five reads that do not need each other, at once, and one that does.
 *
 * WHY THE CASES COME THROUGH `caseReviewsFor`. "Your weakest cases" is one
 * question and the app has learned the hard way that a second query behind
 * the same calculation is a second answer (lib/progress/cases.ts). The rung a
 * situation's cases block is decided from the same rows Progress prints, so
 * a learner told the osastav is at 55 percent on one screen is told the same
 * on this one.

    `Review.slot` says what a card asked and is null on every row written
    before the column existed, which on a deployment this new is most of them.
    Read as recognition, which is the safe direction, those rows would put a
    learner who had produced every word of a unit at "follow it" for as long
    as the old rows outnumber the new ones. The card the row points at still
    knows its type and its case, so a row with no slot takes the card's,
    exactly as `lib/srs/mastery.ts` reads `slotOfCard`. `Review` has no
    relation to `Card` on purpose, so this is a lookup and not a join, and a
    card since deleted leaves its rows as they were.
