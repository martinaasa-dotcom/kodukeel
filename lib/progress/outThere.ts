/**
 * What happened outside the app.
 *
 * Two readings over one table, derived on every request from rows that are
 * facts rather than counters (ADR-014): the answers the learner gave Today
 * over the last thirty days. `outThere` is the panel on Progress, and
 * `outThereToday` is what Today's card needs, which is whether the question
 * has been answered yet and how much has been said this month. A level is
 * what the app measures and the readiness panel is its forecast; this is what
 * a person cares about, which is whether they got through the conversation at
 * the counter.
 *
 * A DAY THAT WAS ANSWERED IS NOT A DAY THAT HELD A CONVERSATION, and the
 * count used to read every row as one. Today asks whether any Estonian was
 * spoken yesterday and takes "not yesterday" for an answer, so a fortnight of
 * honest noes would have been reported back as a fortnight of real
 * conversations and a run of fourteen days. `isConversation` is the one place
 * that is decided and both figures here read it.
