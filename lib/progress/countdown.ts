/**
 * THE DATE SOMEBODY GAVE US, AND WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE IT.
 *
 * A learner answers two questions in their first five minutes here: what they
 * want to reach and by when. The app then stored both and never mentioned them
 * again on the one screen they open every morning. The exam hub knew, the plan
 * screen knew, and Today, which is where somebody decides whether to do
 * fifteen minutes or nothing, did not.
 *
 * "B1 in 47 days, 62 percent likely" is the most motivating sentence this app
 * is in a position to write, and it is also the easiest one to make up. So the
 * evidence tier travels with the number, everywhere, exactly as it does on the
 * hub: a percentage whose basis is not stated is the one thing this feature
 * must not ship (ADR-022). Both screens read `EVIDENCE_LABEL` and
 * `EVIDENCE_NOTE` from `lib/exam/readiness.ts` rather than phrasing their own,
 * because the moment two screens print one number with two accounts of what it
 * is worth, one of them is lying.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A SECOND CALCULATION. `goalsFor` reads the goal,
 * `readinessSignals` gathers the evidence and `assessReadiness` does the
 * arithmetic, all three of them the same ones the hub uses. This picks the
 * target's row out and shapes it for a card.
 *
 * AND WHERE NOBODY NAMED A LEVEL, THE BAND IS THE APP'S OWN AND SAYS SO. The
 * first version returned null there, on the argument that declining to set a
 * target is an answer and a panel arguing with it is the app talking over the
 * person using it. That argument is about a *deadline*, and it was quietly
 * doing something else: a learner who skipped one screen in first run had no
 * confidence figure anywhere on the page they open every morning, which is the
 * one number that answers "how am I doing" in a unit anybody outside this app
 * recognizes. `readiness.next` is the level the climb stopped at, which is
 * derived from the review log rather than chosen for them, so `chosen` travels
 * with it and the card says which it is. Nothing is invented: a band nobody
 * picked is still a band this learner's own answers put them under.
