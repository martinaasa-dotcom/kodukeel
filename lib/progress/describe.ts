/**
 * WHICH SCENES THIS LEARNER IS ASKED ABOUT, AND WHICH CASE EACH ONE ASKS FOR.
 *
 * `lib/collections/scenes.ts` is the table of situations; this is the half
 * that needs a database, which is the split every other pair in this app has.
 *
 * A SCENE IS AS HARD AS ITS HARDEST WORD, read off the entries rather than
 * declared, so a reseed that re-bands a word moves the scene with it and there
 * is no second answer to go stale. Within one band either side of the learner,
 * which is `bandsAround`, the table every other screen bands by.
 *
 * THE CASE COMES FROM THEIR OWN LOG. `caseReviewsFor` and `caseAccuracy` are
 * the one query and the one calculation behind "your weakest cases" everywhere
 * in this app, and reaching for them here rather than writing a fourth
 * `groupBy` is the whole point of their existing: a learner told on Progress
 * that their seesütlev is the weak one should be asked for the seesütlev.
 * Where the log is too thin to say, the case is drawn at random from the
 * eleven, which is honest rather than pretending to a diagnosis.
 *
 * IT GRADES REAL CARDS WHERE IT CAN (ADR-016). A scene whose word is already
 * in the deck carries that card's id and the round writes to the same review
 * log as everything else. A scene whose words are all new carries none, and
 * nothing is graded for it, which is the same answer `/review/emoji` gives:
 * a row about a card that does not exist would be worse than no row.
