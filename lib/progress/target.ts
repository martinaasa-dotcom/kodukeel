/**
 * THE QUESTIONS A TARGET ROUND FIRES AT.
 *
 * A fast aim-and-pick round: a prompt at the top, four targets, hit the right
 * one before the clock runs out. What decides whether it teaches anything is
 * what the targets *are*, and there are two shapes here rather than one.
 *
 * A **meaning** question is the vocabulary round: the Estonian word, four
 * English glosses, ranked by `lib/questions/distractors.ts` so the wrong ones
 * are the same part of speech and the same band and cannot be crossed out
 * without knowing the word.
 *
 * A **case** question is the one this round exists for. The prompt is a word
 * and the question a class names the case by, `maja` and `kus?`, and the four
 * targets are four case forms of that same word: `majas`, `majja`, `majast`,
 * `majani`. Nothing can be eliminated by meaning, because every option means
 * the same word; the only way through is to read the ending. That is the
 * hardest question this app can ask at speed and it is the one an English
 * speaker cannot reason their way around.
 *
 * CASE QUESTIONS LEAD, and the mix is the point rather than a setting. A round
 * of nothing but meanings is a vocabulary quiz, which the deck already has
 * three of; a round of nothing but endings is a grammar drill, which
 * `/review/sprint` already is. Two thirds cases is what makes it a round about
 * Estonian rather than about words.
 *
 * Every option is a form the dictionary vouches for or a gloss it holds.
 * Nothing here is written and nothing is derived beyond what `caseAnswer`
 * already licenses (ADR-005), and a word whose stems will not build four
 * distinct forms is skipped rather than padded.

    AND NOT A CASE THE WORD IS ALREADY SPELLED AS. The prompt is the lemma and

    off the prompt without reading an ending, which is the whole of what this
    question is for. Estonian spells some cases that way: `kallis` has the
    genitive `kalli`, so its seesütlev is `kalli` plus `s`, and `kapsas`,
    `kuningas`, `lusikas`, `maasikas`, `rahvas` and `taevas` do the same.
    Measured on the shipped dictionary, 122 of 51,447 case slots.

    THE TEST IS ON WHAT IS PRINTED, not on every accepted spelling, and that is
    where this differs from `lib/srs/cards.ts`. A typed card takes any of them,
    so any of them showing makes it free. Here one string is drawn on a target
    and the learner hits it, so `voodi` in the illative is refused because
    `voodi` is what the target would say, while a word whose long form is drawn
    beside a short one spelled like the lemma is still a question worth asking.

    Dropped from the pool rather than only from the answer, because a form
    spelled like the prompt is no better as a wrong answer: it is the one option
    nobody has to read.
