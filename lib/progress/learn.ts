/**
 * READING A BATCH OF WORDS FOR THE LEARN LADDER.
 *
 * `lib/learn/ladder.ts` is the rule and holds no database; this is the half
 * that asks one. It is here rather than beside the rule for the reason every
 * pure layer in this app gives about itself: those modules are unit tested
 * without a framework, and one `import { prisma }` inside a directory four
 * hundred tests read puts a database behind all of them.
 *
 * WHAT A WORD IS, HERE. The ladder works on the word rather than on the card,
 * and the card it grades is the word's **recognition** card. That is not a
 * convenience. Every rung asks one question, "do you know this word", at a
 * harder depth each time, and the recognition card is the one row in the deck
 * that stands for exactly that. Its other cards, the production card, the case
 * cards, the gap cards, are drills on a word you already know, which is what
 * Practice is for: a word leaves here the moment its recognition card
 * graduates, and everything else about it is asked over there.
 */

 * How many unseen words are read before five of them are chosen.
 *
 * A deck is filled a unit, a level or a photographed handout at a time, and a
 * whole level arrives at one `createdAt` spanning every band the dictionary
 * has. Taking the five oldest would hand a B1 learner whatever the insert
 * happened to order first, which is the same fault the review queue's own
 * window was widened for. Sixty is one page of rows and gives the level
 * something to choose between.
