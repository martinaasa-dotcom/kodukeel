/**
 * The level the course opens at.
 *
 * Two things measure a learner's Estonian. `/assess` is the fuller instrument:
 * four skills, eighty questions, gapped sentences and dictation and forms typed
 * out. A passed checkpoint on the path is the other, and a level the learner
 * states in Settings is a third answer that is not a measurement at all. (A
 * four-questions-per-level placement ladder used to sit beside these and was
 * removed: it measured recognition only and nothing linked to it.)
 *
 * So the richer one wins where it exists, and the order here is the whole point
 * of this module: without it the app would hold two answers to the same
 * question and let whichever screen the learner happened to open decide. A
 * course arranged around the weaker answer while the better one sat in the
 * database would be the app ignoring what it had already been told.
 *
 * **A third answer outranks both, and it is the learner's own.** Settings has
 * a level picker, and somebody who moved up in the class they are actually
 * sitting in knows something no measurement here does. Ordering by richness
 * alone made that button do nothing: a check sat in March beat a correction
 * made this morning, on every screen that reads a level, silently. So what
 * decides is *when*, not which. Whichever of the two was stated later is the
 * one the app holds, which means the picker takes effect on the next render
 * and a fresh level check takes it back, both without anything to explain.
 *
 * A declaration with no timestamp is read as older than any measurement. That
 * is every row written before the picker existed, and reading it that way is
 * exactly the behavior those deployments already had.
 *
 * `pre-A1` is a real result and not a level the course has units for, so it
 * opens at A1 — which is where somebody below A1 should start anyway.
 */

/**
 * Which answer the app currently holds, and what kind of answer it is.
 *
 * Two readers, one rule. The course wants a band to open at and does not care
 * how it was arrived at; the plan cares very much, because a level a paper
 * measured and a level a stranger ticked in ninety seconds are the same letter
 * and are not worth the same distance (`hoursFor` in lib/assessment/plan.ts).
 * A measured answer carries its per skill levels for the same reason. Both
 * read this so that the timestamp rule above is written once: a plan deciding
 * a learner was measured while the course held their later correction would
 * be the two-answers fault this module exists to prevent, one layer up.
