/**
 * THE DATABASE HALF OF THE IMPACT REPORT.
 *
 * `lib/research/impact.ts` is pure and decides what may be published;
 * everything here is the reading that feeds it. It lives in `lib/progress/`
 * for the reason that directory exists at all: `lib/research/` promises to
 * import no Prisma, and the two readers of these figures are a Route Handler
 * (`/api/metrics`) and a command (`npm run report:impact`), which would
 * otherwise hold two copies of the same six queries and drift apart on the
 * first one somebody corrected.
 *
 * GROUPED IN POSTGRES, NEVER IN NODE. Each query returns one row per learner,
 * which is proportional to how many people there are rather than to the size of
 * the review log, and is also the finest thing the dominance rule can be
 * answered from. No individual review is materialized in this process. That is
 * `/api/research`'s rule and it is this file's rule too, because `Review` is the
 * largest table in the schema and there is no version of this report worth
 * reading every row for.
 *
 * THE OPT-OUT IS IN THE QUERIES. Settings lets anybody keep their own rows out
 * of research, and the rule is that the rows are never read rather than
 * subtracted afterwards. So the exclusion is spliced into every query here
 * separately, including the retention scan, and `gatherImpact` reads the list
 * before it reads anything else.
