/**
 * The streak, against the database, on the learner's own clock.
 *
 * It was rewritten once from "load every review of the last 400 days" to a
 * distinct-day aggregate, because the original got slower the more somebody
 * used the app. These check the aggregate still returns the same answer.
 *
 * AND THEY DRIVE `resolveStreakFor` RATHER THAN A COPY OF ITS QUERY. The
 * earlier version of this file kept its own `SELECT ... AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`
 * beside the real one, and that copy is precisely what went stale the moment
 * the real query learned about timezones: the test would have gone on
 * asserting that UTC days give the right answer while the app had stopped
 * using them. A list in a test that shadows a list in the code is the fault
 * `PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` exists to prevent, and a query is a list.
 *
 * The case that matters is the last one. A learner in Tallinn who studied on
 * Monday morning, at one in the morning on Tuesday and again on Wednesday
 * morning kept a three-day streak. Those sittings fall in two UTC days with a
 * hole between them, and the app used to read that as a streak of 1 — and, if
 * they had a shield banked, spend it bridging a Tuesday they had not missed.
