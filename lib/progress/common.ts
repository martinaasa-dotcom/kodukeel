 * part of speech and a group, because a gloss copied into a generated table
 * goes stale the first time somebody corrects one. So this joins the ranking
 * to the dictionary and to the learner's own deck, which is the whole of the
 * module: two reads and no arithmetic.
 *
 * A word the dictionary does not have is dropped rather than shown grayed out.
 * That is not a hypothetical: a deployment seeded before the course harvest
 * holds a few hundred words, and a page listing four hundred with three
 * hundred crossed through is a page about this app rather than about Estonian.
 * The section says how many it found, so a short list says so out loud.
