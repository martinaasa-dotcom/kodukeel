 * of them, because both were counting every report as a conversation and
 * Today now takes "not yesterday" for an answer: a fortnight of honest noes
 * would have been reported back as a fortnight of real conversations and a
 * run of fourteen days, on the panel this app says it is measured by.
 *
 * The clock is pinned to a zone rather than the process's own, since a day
 * boundary with no zone is the deployment's midnight (`lib/time/day.ts`) and
 * "answered today" is the whole of what the card reads.
