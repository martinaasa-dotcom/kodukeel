 * The complaint this suite exists for was one sentence: an account set to
 * learn B1 opened the app and was taught `keskmine`, an A1 adjective meaning
 * "average". That word matches no gloss the almanac can ask for, which is how
 * we know which of the two paths produced it, and the fallback path filtered
 * on nothing at all: it counted every entry with a gloss and took whichever
 * one the day's number landed on.
 *
 * Both halves of the fix need a database to say anything. The band is a
 * `cefr` column, the pool is six thousand rows wide, and the whole claim is
 * about which row a skip lands on, so a fixture of three invented words could
 * not fail here in the way that matters.
