/**
 * The dictionary material a paper at this level can be built out of.
 *
 * Words at or below the level. Entries with no CEFR tag are admitted from B1
 * upwards, which is where the untagged part of the dictionary mostly sits.
 *
 * THE POOL IS DRAWN WITH THE PAPER'S OWN SEED, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A PAPER
 * REBUILDABLE.
 *
 * `submitExam` builds the paper again on the server to mark it, hours after it
 * was sat, and `buildPaper` is deterministic in (level, seed, pool). Two of
 * those three were promised and the third was not: this query used to take the
 * first five hundred rows of an order beginning `fetchedAt desc`, and
 * `fetchedAt` is rewritten by `runEnrich` and `runLookup` on *every* lookup of
 * a word, including one that changes nothing about it. So any learner opening
 * the dictionary during somebody's ninety-minute paper reordered the pool, the
 * cut at five hundred took a different set, and the item ids are positional:
 * the answers were marked against questions nobody had been asked. The comment
 * that used to sit here named that as the thing this file exists to prevent.
 *
 * It was also picking badly. Every entry the seed writes carries an
 * `ekilexWordId` and nearly every one carries a usage, so `fetchedAt` was the
 * only column separating them, and on a deployment where nobody has looked
 * anything up every value of it is null. The whole order then fell through to
 * `lemma asc`, so the pool at B1 was the first five hundred words of the
 * dictionary alphabetically: the `aberratsioon` fault the suggestion row was
 * fixed for, in the one place that decides what somebody is examined on.
 *
 * So the eligible set is read as ids in an order nothing can move, the seed
 * shuffles it, and the first `POOL_SIZE` are the pool. The paper is then a
 * function of (level, seed) and of which words the dictionary holds at all,
 * which changes when a word is added and not when one is read. It is also a
 * fair draw across the level rather than the head of the alphabet.
 *
 * The preference for entries carrying a sentence is not expressed here and was
 * not expressed by the ordering it replaces either: the sentence is what three
 * tasks need, and `buildPaper` already refuses a task it cannot fill and
 * reports the shortfall. Measured on the shipped dictionary, 95% of eligible
 * entries carry one, so a draw of five hundred brings about four hundred and
 * seventy-five of them.
 *
 * One deploy's worth of papers in flight are marked against a pool drawn the
 * new way, which is the cost of changing this at all and is smaller than the
 * fault: today a paper is mis-marked whenever anybody looks a word up.
