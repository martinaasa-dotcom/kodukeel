 * average, so a row written before it holds a number today's app would not
 * produce from the same measurement. Printing it would put two rules on one
 * screen, and the history list is exactly where they would sit side by side.
 *
 * So the measurement is what is preserved and the reading is recomputed. That
 * is the same reasoning as "progress is derived, never stored", arriving one
 * table late: the column stays because it is what a row written today records,
 * and every reader goes through here.
