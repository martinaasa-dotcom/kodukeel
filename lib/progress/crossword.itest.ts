  AND IT STATES THE ONE THING IT CANNOT MAKE FOR ITSELF.

  This is a fact about the shipped dictionary, so a dictionary some other suite
  left behind is a different question with the same name. `test-restore.mjs`
  empties it and restores it, `test-edit.mjs` corrects an entry, and
  `test-containment.mjs` ticks a word into it: run any of those first on a
  machine that is not CI and this failed with "B1 on 2026-01-01 got no grid",
  which reads as the compiler being broken and sends whoever hits it into
  `lib/games/crossword.ts`. It happened, and it cost an hour of looking in the
  wrong file.

  So the precondition is asked once, in words, before the thirty days are
  compiled. `SEED_SET_SIZE` is the seed's own count and `seedSize.test.ts`
  keeps it honest, so this is the same number `npm run db:seed` writes.
