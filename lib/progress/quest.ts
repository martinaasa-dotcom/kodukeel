/**
 * THE DAILY QUEST'S POOL: WHAT IS GOING WRONG, ASKED AGAIN TODAY.
 *
 * A two-minute round on the learner's own weak points, asked for directly:
 * "Only pick their weakest words (the ones they get wrong the most) and see
 * where they stand today."
 *
 * WEAKEST *CASES* FIRST, NOT ONLY WEAKEST WORDS, and that is the half worth
 * spelling out. A deck's failures cluster by grammar rather than by vocabulary:
 * somebody does not fail `tuba` and `kool` for unrelated reasons, they fail the
 * seesütlev on both. Ranking cards by lapses alone finds the symptom and asks
 * about it word by word; ranking by the case behind them finds the thing that
 * needs fixing and asks about it eight ways. `caseAccuracy` over
 * `caseReviewsFor` is the same query and the same calculation the Progress page
 * and the Practice page read, so the three cannot disagree about which case a
 * learner is worst at.
 *
 * A card carrying no case still gets in, and has to: a learner whose case cards
 * are all fine is not a learner with nothing to work on, and a round that came
 * back empty for them would be the app saying it had nothing to offer on the
 * day it was most sure of itself.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored. Which cases are weakest is derived from the
 * append-only log on every request, like everything else in `lib/progress/`
 * (ADR-014).

   * This round picks the cases a learner is worst at, and then asked them to
   * mark their own paper on exactly those. The verdict went into `Review`,
   * which is append-only, and `caseAccuracy` reads it back to decide which
   * cases are weak: the panel that chose the cards was being fed by the round
   * that claimed to be fixing them, on the learner's own say-so. A "Had it"
   * is not evidence, and every figure downstream of it was presented as
   * measured.
   *
   * The round's own argument for a flip is sound and is untouched: two minutes
   * of typing is about eight cards, and this round is about volume across a
   * weakness. What was never true is that self-grading is the only thing that
   * is as fast. Picking one of four is a tap, exactly as "Had it" was a tap.
   *
   * `slot` is what the option would say about the learner if they took it, so
   * a wrong pick can be written down as the confusion it is rather than as a
   * bare failure. See `Review.reachedSlot`: naming it needs the whole singular
   * of the word, which only the server holds, so it travels with the option
   * rather than being worked out in the browser.
