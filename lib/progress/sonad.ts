/**
 * WHICH WORD SÕNAD IS ABOUT TODAY, AND WHICH WORDS IT WILL ACCEPT.
 *
 * Two lists, and the difference between them is the whole design.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS A GRADED DICTIONARY ENTRY at the learner's own level, because
 * an answer has to be a word this app can teach: the finish screen names it,
 * glosses it, links to its entry and offers to put it in the deck, and none of
 * that works for a word out of the tail of the expansion. Banded on
 * `bandsAround` like every other screen that chooses a word for somebody, which
 * also means the pool follows a learner up: 215 answers at A1, 477 at B1.
 *
 * THE GUESSES ARE THE WHOLE LANGUAGE, IN EVERY FORM. `KnownWord` held the
 * 154,995 headwords the Ekilex enumeration brought back, 7,134 of them six
 * letters long, and a learner typed `põhjas`, the seesütlev of `põhi`, and was
 * told it was not a word. Telling somebody that an ordinary Estonian word is
 * not a word is the one thing a game like this must never do, and a headword
 * list does it to every case of every noun. The guesses are the forms list
 * now (`lib/dict/forms.ts`), 60,812 spellings at six letters.
 *
 * THE DAY DECIDES, NOT A RANDOM NUMBER, so the board survives a reload and two
 * people at the same level talking about it are talking about one word. The
 * key is the learner's own day (`lib/time/day.ts`), because a server's midnight
 * is the deployment's.
 *
 * NOTHING IS STORED. What guesses have been made lives on the device, the way
 * an unfinished mock exam does, and the answer is recomputed from the date. A
 * round finished is a `Review` row if the word is in the deck and nothing at
 * all otherwise, which is ADR-014's rule: no counter, no stored score.

    AS THE DICTIONARY STOOD WHEN THE DAY BEGAN, because the board and the
    marking are two draws. The board is built when the learner opens it and
    `recordSonad` builds the puzzle again to mark it, and the dictionary grows
    in between: a live lookup stores a word, a conversation stores what it
    needed. One word of six letters in the band added at noon moved the skip,
    and a round solved on `kahjum` was marked against `usklik`, measured in
    `sonad.itest.ts` on every one of eight days. A row stored after the day
    began, anywhere, is left out of that day's pool (`earliestStartOf`).

    A dictionary seeded after the day began has nothing from before it, and
    that day falls back to the whole pool rather than to no puzzle; the cutoff
    is fixed for the day, so the fallback is the same one both times.

    What this cannot see is an entry that MOVED into or out of the band during
    the day, which a live enrichment does when Ekilex grades a word
    differently: that needs the row as it was, and nothing keeps it.
