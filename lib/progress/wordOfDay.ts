/**
 * THE WORD OF THE DAY, AND WHY IT IS THAT WORD.
 *
 * The panel this feeds used to be called "word to revisit" and drew the card
 * with the most lapses on it. That is a useful thing to know and it is not a
 * word of the day: it is a word you already have, already failed, and are
 * already going to be asked about this afternoon by the scheduler. It now
 * lives in the sticking points panel, where the rest of "what is fighting you"
 * is, and this is the other thing entirely.
 *
 * TWO RULES DECIDE WHICH WORD.
 *
 * It has to be one the learner has NOT met. Not in their deck, not in their
 * review log, not starred. A word of the day that turns out to be card four of
 * today's review is a coincidence, not a present, and the whole point of the
 * panel is that it is the one thing on this page the rest of the app is not
 * already going to show you.
 *
 * And it has to arrive with a reason. `lib/copy/almanac.ts` decides what today
 * is and which English gloss that asks for, this asks the dictionary who
 * carries it, and the card prints the reason next to the word. A word with a
 * reason is remembered and a word drawn at random is scrolled past.
 *
 * THE LEVEL IS A TIE-BREAK ON ONE PATH AND A FILTER ON THE OTHER, AND THAT
 * ASYMMETRY IS MEASURED RATHER THAN TIDY. A B1 learner was shown `keskmine`,
 * an A1 adjective meaning "average", which is a word they had before they
 * started. The obvious fix is to band both paths on `bandsAround`, the way
 * every other screen that chooses a word for somebody does, and on the themed
 * path it is worse than doing nothing: the almanac asks for meanings, and the
 * meanings a calendar has are `snow`, `hand`, `week` and `first`, which are A1
 * words because that is what those meanings are in any language. Measured over
 * a year of the shipped dictionary at B1, banding the themed pick moved 37
 * days of 336 out of the alphabetically first candidates and into words whose
 * gloss carries the day's meaning as a fourth sense, on 31 days that had the
 * primary one. There is no B1 word for snow. So the themed path ranks on the
 * band **after** the sense, which changes six days and costs nothing, and the
 * word arrives at whatever level the meaning happens to live at, which is the
 * honest answer to "here is a word for today".
 *
 * `pickAny` has no meaning to honor and is where the fault actually was: it
 * filtered on nothing at all, so its skip landed anywhere in six thousand
 * entries. It bands.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE WRITES ESTONIAN, WHICH IS THE POINT OF THE SPLIT (ADR-005). The
 * almanac is English and asks for a meaning. The Estonian is whatever the
 * dictionary already held: the lemma from Ekilex or the built expansion, the
 * gloss from Wiktionary, the example sentence a lexicographer recorded. This
 * module joins them and invents nothing, exactly as `scripts/expand-seed.ts`
 * does one layer down.
 */

/**
 * WHERE A CARD ADDED FROM THIS PANEL SAYS IT CAME FROM.
 *
 * `Card.source` already separates a word taken from the dictionary, a unit of
 * the path, a pasted list, a scan and one Anu suggested, so the panel gets its
 * own value rather than a counter somewhere. That is the whole of how the
 * collection is counted: no column, no total, no stored streak, just cards that
 * know where they came from and `createdAt`, which is the rule progress in this
 * app has always followed (ADR-014). A number that is added up from what
 * actually happened cannot be awarded for something that did not.
