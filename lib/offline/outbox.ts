 * The rules for grades taken while the connection was gone.
 *
 * Review is the daily path and CLAUDE.md requires it to work offline, but
 * grading is a server action, so until now a lost connection lost the session.
 *
 * What makes this tractable is the append-only review log. A grade is a fact
 * about a moment — "at 08:41 I rated this Good" — not a request to compute
 * something. Facts commute with waiting: replaying them later, in order, with
 * their original timestamps, produces exactly the state that would have existed
 * had the network never dropped, because `grade()` takes `now` as a parameter.
 * There is no conflict to resolve and no merge to get wrong. That is the payoff
 * for the discipline of never updating a Review row.
 *
 * This module is pure so the ordering and clamping rules can be tested without a
 * browser; `lib/offline/db.ts` is the thin IndexedDB layer beneath it.
