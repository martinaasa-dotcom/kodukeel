  Ekilex writes government differently from the seed, and the difference was

  The seed puts the case name at the front. Ekilex records the question words a
  lexicographer noted, each annotated with the case it signals, ordered with
  the primary government first. Read with the rule written for the seed, the
  case came out of the app's own list order instead of the entry's, so a verb
  governing the allative was drilled as taking the partitive. The learner
  memorizes whatever the drill says, which makes a confidently wrong answer
  the worst thing this screen can do.
