 * its own example sentences would be drilling invented morphology into memory,
 * which is the one failure this codebase is organized to prevent.

/**
 * Is this a sentence a learner should be asked to read at all?

 * comes back under a headword is sometimes not a sentence and sometimes not
 * about the word a learner thinks they are being asked. Three shapes turned up
 * in a real sitting and all three are mechanical.
 *
 * A usage that trails off, carries a slash between two alternatives, or is
 * numbered out of a list of definitions is a dictionary's own shorthand rather
 * than a sentence: `Uuringud näitavad, et ..` and `Elekter läks ära / kadus.`
 * are both perfectly good lexicography and neither is answerable. A usage with
 * no closing punctuation is a fragment for the same reason.
 *
 * And a usage that opens with the headword followed by a comma is the label
 * pattern, where the entry names itself and then illustrates: `Kahvel, lipp
 * kukub!` is filed under `kahvel` and is a sailing call about a gaff, not a
 * fork, which is exactly the question a learner cannot answer and cannot
 * argue with. Only a nominal is caught by it, because a verb standing before a
 * comma is an ordinary main clause: `Usun, et ta ei valeta` is a real
 * sentence and stays.
 *
 * Measured over the shipped dictionary: 8,826 usages pass the length rules and
 * this rejects 101 of them, so it costs almost nothing and it removes the ones
 * that were being read as errors in the app.
 */
/**
 * The label pattern, as `naturalSentence` needs to be told about it.
 *
 * A usage that opens with its own headword and a comma is a dictionary
 * illustrating a sense rather than a sentence somebody said, and the sense is
 * often not the one the gloss beside it names. Only a nominal, because a verb
 * before a comma is an ordinary main clause.
 *
 * It lives here rather than beside either caller because there are two: the
 * level check has always passed it and the deck's gap-fill cards did not, so
 * `Kahvel, lipp kukub!` was refused in an exam and made into a flashcard.
 *
 * AND IT IS A NOUN'S RULE, WHICH THE NAME SAID AND THE CODE DID NOT. The
 * exemption was `VERB` alone, so an adverb, an adjective, a pronoun and a
 * phrase were all read as nominals, and the one word class whose natural
 * position *is* "word, then clause" is the interjection. `tere` has two
 * recorded usages and this refused `Tere, mina olen Katrin.`, leaving `No
 * tere, Juhan.` as the only sentence the first unit anybody opens could teach
 * hello with. `Aitäh, Mari!` went the same way, and `Nõus, teeme nii.`, and
 * `Imelik, et teda kodus pole.` Ten sentences across the dictionary, nine of
 * them ordinary speech and four of them on an A1 or A2 word.
 *
 * A noun is the word class a dictionary labels a sense with, which is the
 * whole of what the pattern detects: an entry naming itself and then
 * illustrating. Every refusal worth keeping is one — `Kahvel, lipp kukub!`,
 * `Vabadus, võrdsus, vendlus.`, `Standardkeel, õppijakeel jt keele
 * kasutusvariandid.` Narrowing to the noun keeps all fifteen of those and
 * hands back the ten it should never have taken.
