/**
 * THE ELEVEN REGULAR CASES, AND THE ONE THAT IS NOT.
 *
 * Ten of the eleven non-principal cases really are a suffix on the genitive
 * stem, the same suffix for every word in the language. The illative is not,
 * and this module used to pretend it was.
 *
 * Estonian has two illatives. The long one is `genitive + sse` and is what a
 * rule can produce. The short one, the *aditiiv*, is lexically unpredictable
 * and is the form people actually say: `tuba` goes to `tuppa`, not `toasse`;
 * `aeg` to `aega`, not `ajasse`; `abi` to `appi`, not `abisse`. The dictionary
 * has held it all along, as `ILL_SG_SHORT` from the seed and `SgAdt` from
 * Ekilex, and 2,969 of the shipped entries carry one. Every single one of them
 * differs from the suffix rule, because a word whose short illative *is* the
 * long one has no short illative recorded.
 *
 * `NounStems` had no field for it, so the table could not show it even in
 * principle, and `deriveCase` took a bare genitive, so the eight callers that
 * wanted a case form could not have consulted it if they had wanted to. The
 * landing page taught `toasse`, the dictionary entry printed it, and
 * `lib/srs/cards.ts` made it the answer side of a flashcard: a learner typing
 * `tuppa` was told they were wrong, and the scheduler brought the card back
 * until they stopped typing it.
 *
 * SO THE STEMS CARRY IT AND THE FIELD IS REQUIRED. `illSgShort: string | null`
 * rather than `illSgShort?: string`, which is the whole of the fix that
 * matters: `null` says the dictionary was asked and holds none, and a caller
 * that never asked cannot produce a value the type will accept. That is the
 * shape `buildOptions` uses for verb government one module over, and for the
 * same reason: a rule nobody can forget beats a rule everybody is told about.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED IS STILL DERIVED, and ADR-005 amendment 1 still holds. A
 * suffix on a stored stem is one bug for the whole language rather than one
 * word wrong unpredictably. The change is that an attested form now always
 * beats a derived one, which was supposed to be true and was not.
 *
 * AND THE NOMINATIVE PLURAL IS NOT A SUFFIX AT ALL, which is the same fault
 * again on the other side of the table. `genSg + d` was written here as though
 * it were the one regular plural, and `scripts/audit-cases.ts` put it to the
 * Institute for every nominal the dictionary ships: 5,098 of 5,143 agree, and
 * the ones that do not are not a rounding error, they are a category. **Every
 * pronoun in the dictionary that has a plural was wrong**, all eight of them,
 * because a pronoun is suppletive there and no ending reaches it: `see` goes
 * to `need` and this printed `selled`, `too` goes to `nood` and this printed
 * `tolled`, and `kes` and `mis` do not change at all and were printed as
 * `kelled` and `milled`. Those are the first words in anybody's first lesson.
 * And 33 nouns have no plural for Ekilex to record, mass nouns like `sealiha`
 * and `sularaha`, which were being given `sealihad` and `sularahad`.
 *
 * So `nomPl` is a **required** field for the reason `illSgShort` is one, and
 * nothing derives it. Where the dictionary holds the plural it is printed;
 * where the dictionary holds none the row is a gap, which is what the genitive
 * plural and the partitive plural have always done and is ADR-005. `NOM_PL` is
 * on `PRINCIPAL_FORM_TYPES` now, so the harvest, the live enrichment, a hand
 * edit and an accepted correction all carry it by construction.
