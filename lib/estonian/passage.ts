/**
 * Gap-fill exercises built from a passage the learner pasted.
 *
 * Distinct from `./cloze`, which blanks a word out of an example sentence Ekilex
 * recorded. This one works on text the learner brought — their homework, an
 * article, a message — and is why the two live apart despite doing something
 * that sounds the same.
 *
 * The importer already accepts pasted text, but only ever harvested word pairs
 * out of it. That throws away the most valuable thing on the clipboard: a real
 * Estonian sentence, with a real inflected form in a real context.
 *
 * The trick that makes this safe is that nothing is generated. The answer to a
 * cloze is the word that was already sitting in the learner's own text, so it is
 * authoritative by construction — more so than a derived form, because a native
 * writer put it there. The app's only job is to notice which words it recognizes
 * and blank them.
 *
 * This module is pure. It knows nothing about the database; the caller supplies
 * whatever forms it wants matched.
