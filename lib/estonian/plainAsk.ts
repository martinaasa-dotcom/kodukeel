/**
 * WHAT A SLOT IS ASKING FOR, IN THE WORDS SOMEBODY WOULD USE OUT LOUD.
 *
 * A learner reported a flash card headed "Put it in the lihtminevik · ma" and
 * said they could not tell what it wanted. They were right, and the reply they
 * wrote is the specification for this file: the word is `kohtuma`, and what the
 * card is actually asking is how you say it about yourself, in the past. The
 * answer was `kohtusin`, and nothing on the screen said so in a way somebody
 * could act on without already knowing what `lihtminevik` means.
 *
 * That is not an argument against the Estonian names. CLAUDE.md is emphatic
 * about them and it is right: a class in Tallinn, a school textbook and the
 * state examination all name a case by its Estonian name and by the question it
 * answers, and a learner who has only ever met "the inessive" cannot follow
 * their own teacher. What was missing is the layer under it. Somebody who has
 * not met `seesütlev` yet needs to know what is being asked *before* they can
 * learn what it is called, and a name they cannot cash in is furniture.
 *
 * So this is the third thing a screen can say about a slot, beside the Estonian
 * name and the English one, and it is the one that leads on a card: a clause
 * that finishes "How do you say this ...?" and means something to a person who
 * has never opened a grammar book. The name stays on the screen underneath it,
 * where it is the cross-reference it was always meant to be.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS GENERATED AND NOTHING HERE IS ESTONIAN. Every clause is
 * authored English about a slot key, which is the same latitude
 * `lib/estonian/grammar.ts` takes: English is the one language this project
 * writes. In particular a clause never inflects the learner's word in either
 * language. "I met" would read better than "about yourself, already happened",
 * and there is no rule that turns "to meet" into "met" for every verb in
 * English any more than there is one that turns `kohtuma` into `kohtusin`, so
 * the clause describes the form rather than spelling it. The dictionary spells
 * it, after the answer.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY PARTIAL, like `lib/estonian/terms.ts` and for its reason. A slot
 * is in the table only where a plain sentence says something a name does not.
 * `PRODUCTION` is not in it, because "how do you say this word" is already the
 * whole question and a clause under it would be the question again.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no Estonian.
