/**
 * What each grammar point is *called*, in the language it is taught in.
 *
 * Estonian is not taught anywhere by its Latin case names or by the English
 * names of tenses it does not have. A course in Tallinn, a school textbook and
 * the state examination all name a case by its Estonian name and, more often,
 * by the question it answers: nobody says "the inessive", they ask "kus?".
 * The verb system is named the same way — `olevik` and `lihtminevik`, the two
 * tenses Estonian actually inflects for, and then `kõneviis`, `tegumood` and
 * `pööre` as separate axes rather than a row of English-shaped tenses.
 *
 * This app is written in English for English speakers, so the English name is
 * kept: somebody reading an English reference grammar needs it, and somebody
 * taking a course needs the other one. What changes is which one leads. The
 * Estonian term and the question are the identity; the English name is a
 * cross-reference, and it is labeled as one.
 *
 * Two things hold this file to being terminology rather than a back door into
 * ADR-005:
 *
 * 1. **A term names a category, never a word.** No example, no inflected form,
 *    no sentence. `terms.test.ts` holds it to a short name shaped like one, the
 *    same latitude `cases.ts` already takes for the case names and question
 *    words it has always carried.
 * 2. **The list is deliberately partial.** A point is here only where there is
 *    a settled term a course actually uses. Where there is not, the point keeps
 *    its English description rather than being given an invented Estonian name,
 *    because a term nobody says is worse than an English one everybody
 *    understands. `grammarTerm()` returning `undefined` is the honest answer
 *    and every caller renders it as one.
