/**
 * The reference layer: what each ending is *for*, in English.
 *
 * Every drill in the app can tell a learner they got `toas` wrong. None of them
 * can tell them that -s is the ending that means "in", and that Estonian glues
 * it on where English would reach for a preposition. That gap is where people
 * give up, and a tutor conversation is a poor substitute for a page you can
 * re-read on the bus.
 *
 * WHAT LEADS IS THE ENDING AND WHAT IT MEANS. Not the Latin name, and not the
 * Estonian one either. Nobody working out how to say "in the room" is looking
 * for the inessive; they are looking for -s. The names are on the page, because
 * a learner in a class hears `seesütlev` and a learner with an English grammar
 * reads "inessive", and both have to be able to find their way in. They are the
 * cross-reference. The ending and the plain English word are the identity.
 *
 * Three rules hold this file together:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing here is Estonian.** Not an example, not a form, not a phrase.
 *    The case names and the question words already live in `cases.ts`, taken
 *    from the domain model; everything added here is English prose about
 *    Estonian, which is the one thing the app is allowed to author (ADR-005).
 *    `grammar.test.ts` keeps a tripwire on it: a regex cannot tell prose from a
 *    smuggled form, but Estonian of any length reaches for its own letters.
 * 2. **It is framework-free data.** The page that renders it pairs each note
 *    with real forms out of the learner's own dictionary rows, so the examples
 *    on screen are always attested and always words they are actually studying.
 * 3. **One line per field.** A reference nobody finishes reading has taught
 *    nobody anything, and the version before this one ran to four paragraphs a
 *    case. `summary` is a sentence, `uses` are three short phrases, `watchOut`
 *    is the single mistake worth naming. Anything longer belongs in a lesson.
