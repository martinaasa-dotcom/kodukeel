/**
 * The present tense, the conditional and the negative, from the one form the
 * dictionary stores for them.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DERIVES, AND WHY THAT IS ALLOWED.
 *
 * A seeded verb carries five principal parts and nothing else, so on a
 * deployment without an Ekilex key every one of the 799 verbs in the built
 * dictionary showed `loen` and stopped: no `loed`, no `loeb`, no `ei loe`,
 * and a conjugation card for `olevik · ta` could not be built at all. A
 * learner met `lugema` as "to read" and the present tense of it as one
 * person, which is a verb taught as a noun.
 *
 * The present indicative is the one part of the Estonian verb that really is
 * a suffix on a stored stem for every verb in the language but one. Take the
 * `n` off the first person and the other five are `d`, `b`, `me`, `te`,
 * `vad`; the negative is the bare stem after `ei`; the conditional is the
 * same stem with `ksin`, `ksid`, `ks`, `ksime`, `ksite`, `ksid`; and the
 * singular imperative is the stem again. That is ADR-005 amendment 1 exactly:
 * a deterministic rule over a form already stored, wrong the same way for
 * every word that takes the ending, which is one bug found once. It is the
 * same license `derive.ts` takes for the ten regular cases on the genitive.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DERIVE. The simple past has to be stored per verb, because
 * the third person is not readable from the first: `lugesin` goes to `luges`
 * and `tahtsin` to `tahtis` and `võtsin` to `võttis`, with the grade changing
 * on the way. The impersonal and the plural imperative are built on stems this
 * module does not hold. And `olema` is the one exception in the present: its
 * third person is `on`, which no rule reaches, so it gets nothing from here
 * and its forms come from Ekilex, where every verb's do the moment an entry is
 * opened on a deployment with a key. `minema` is the one exception in the
 * imperative for the same reason.
 *
 * CHECKED, NOT REASONED ABOUT. `scripts/audit-verbs.ts` derives every form
 * below for every verb in the shipped dictionary and compares it against the
 * paradigm Ekilex records for the same word. The exceptions named here are
 * the ones that audit found, and it is the thing to re-run before widening
 * this table.
 *
 * Every form carries `origin: "DERIVED"`, and every screen that prints one
 * says so, the way the case table does.

 * and `IndIpfSg3` is the one slot in that half no rule reaches for any verb in
 * the language.
 *
 * THE TWO PARTICIPLES ARE HERE FOR A DIFFERENT REASON, and they are the reason
 * this list is no longer only about what a screen prints. Nothing shows them
 * and no card asks one. What they are is the form the perfect is built out of:
 * `Kui kaua see on kestnud?` is how anybody asks how long something has been
 * going on, the course teaches täisminevik on its own grammar page, and the
 * dictionary could not vouch for a single `nud` in the language. `eval:scene`
 * is what found that, the same way it found the polite imperative, and it is
 * the same answer: neither is derivable, since `minna` goes to `läinud`, `teha`
 * to `teinud` and `näha` to `näinud`, so what the rule cannot reach is stored
 * from Ekilex rather than left absent.
 *
 * Storing a form and asking a card about it are two decisions and only the
 * first is made here. A participle is met inside a construction rather than as
 * a slot, so what this buys is that the dictionary can vouch for one, gap-fill
 * one, and find one from the search box.
 *
 * THE TWO INFINITIVES ARE HERE FOR THEIR PARALLELS ALONE. Both are principal
 * parts, so the entry already holds one of each and the harvest drops what it
 * already holds. What is left is the second stem of a verb Ekilex records as
 * two sets of forms: `öelda` beside `ütelda`, the infinitive anybody says.
