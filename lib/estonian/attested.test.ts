/*
  EVERY FORM THE SHIPPED DICTIONARY ATTESTS IS THE FORM THE APP SHOWS.

  This exists because the app taught `toasse` for a year. The illative is the
  one case of the eleven with a lexically unpredictable form, the dictionary
  held it for 2,969 entries under `ILL_SG_SHORT`, and `NounStems` had no field
  to put it in, so every screen printed a suffix on the genitive instead: the
  landing page's own demonstration, the dictionary entry, the grammar
  reference, and the back of a flashcard the scheduler then drilled.

  A unit test rather than an invariant, because the question is about 5,363
  rows of data rather than about the shape of the source, and because it has to
  be able to fail on a word: an invariant that reads the code cannot tell
  whether `tuppa` is what comes out the other end.

  Hermetic. It reads the two files `npm run db:seed` loads and nothing else.
