/**
 * Free-production exercises: "write a sentence putting `tuba` in the inessive".
 *
 * This is the half of the feature that does not involve a model, and it is
 * deliberately the half that decides whether the learner was right about the
 * *form*. ADR-005 forbids the model supplying an Estonian form, and the reason
 * generalizes: a model is not trustworthy about Estonian morphology, so it must
 * not be the thing that says whether a morpheme is correct either.
 *
 * So the split is:
 *   - the target form comes from Ekilex, or from the app's own derivation off
 *     the genitive stem — the same two sources the dictionary already trusts,
 *   - whether the learner used that form is checked here, by string matching,
 *   - and the model is left with what it is genuinely good at: judging whether
 *     the surrounding sentence is idiomatic, and explaining why.
 *
 * A model that hallucinates therefore cannot mark a correct answer wrong on the
 * morphology, which is the failure that would destroy trust fastest.
