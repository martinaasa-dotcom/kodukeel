/**
 * WHICH CASES ARE WORTH ASKING A WORD ABOUT, AND HOW TO WORD THE QUESTION.
 *
 * Two facts decide both, and neither is in the spelling. Estonian has two sets
 * of local cases and two interrogative pronouns, and a word takes one of each:
 * a room is somewhere you are inside and is a `mis`, a horse is neither.
 *
 *   tuba      toas, toast, tuppa      milles? millest? millesse?
 *   hobune    hobusel, hobuselt, hobusele    kellel? kellelt? kellele?
 *
 * The app had half of the first rule, in `lib/estonian/place.ts`, which reads
 * the ending `-maa` so that `Saksamaa` is drilled on `Saksamaal` rather than on
 * `Saksamaas`. It had none of the second, and `place.ts` says in its own header
 * why it could not have: an ending is all a spelling can tell you, and nothing
 * about the letters in `hobune` says it is an animal.
 *
 * So every animate noun in the dictionary was drilled on the wrong trio, under
 * the wrong question word: `hobune → millesse? kuhu?` wanting `hobusesse`,
 * `koer → milles? kus?` wanting `koeras`, `ema → millesse?` wanting `emasse`.
 * A learner who passes those cards has learned to say `ma annan raamatu
 * õpetajasse`, and a learner who asks their teacher about it is told the app
 * is wrong. `lib/estonian/semantics.ts` is where the missing fact comes from,
 * and it comes from the Institute rather than from a list written here.
 *
 * ONE PREDICATE RATHER THAN ONE LIST, because the generators legitimately ask
 * about different numbers of cases and only the *fit* is shared. A flashcard
 * drills five cases, the lesson planner seven, the writing exercise ten and the
 * daily quest all eleven, and each of those is a decision about how much to
 * ask. Which of them make sense for the word in front of you is not.
 *
 * That distinction is what let the fault spread. `localCasesFor` was written to
 * fix the `-maa` words and only two of the eight places that pick a case ever
 * called it, so the lesson planner, the writing exercise, the daily quest and
 * the picture round all went on asking `Saksamaa → milles? kus?` after it was
 * fixed. `caseFits` is what they all read now, and an invariant fails on a
 * ninth that picks a local case without asking.
 */

/**
 * What has to be known about a word before a case question can be asked of it.
 *
 * `semanticTypes` is required rather than optional, which is the whole of what
 * makes this stick: `null` says the dictionary was asked and holds no
 * classification, and a caller that never asked cannot satisfy the type. It is
 * the shape `NounStems.illSgShort` and `buildOptions`'s `Government` already
 * take, and for the same reason — a rule nobody can forget beats a rule
 * everybody is told about.

/**
 * IS THIS CASE A FORM THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT USE FOR THIS WORD?
 *
 * `caseFits` is the builder's question and this is the deleter's, and they are
 * not each other's negation. That distinction was learned the expensive way:
 * `scripts/audit-decks.ts` removes cards from a learner's deck, its first
 * version asked `caseFits` alone, and run against a deployment seeded before
 * `semanticTypes` was filled it condemned 318 correct cards. 6,952 entries,
 * none of them classified, and every correct *outside* card in the database
 * named for removal: `isa → isale`, `õpetaja → õpetajale`, `arst → arstile`.
 *
 * The gap between the two questions is exactly where the dictionary is silent.
 * `localCasesFor` reads "we do not know" as the inside trio, and its own header
 * says why: an unclassified word is one somebody typed in or confirmed off a
 * photograph, and reading the silence as "it is a person" would break cards
 * that are currently right. That is the safe end for a builder, which *makes*
 * things, and the dangerous end for anything that *removes* them.
 *
 * So this asks for positive evidence and only ever in one direction. `isas` is
 * a form nobody says; `toale` is ordinary Estonian that the builder happens not
 * to choose for a room, and `maa`, which the Institute calls both a place and
 * an area, has two ordinary readings rather than a wrong one. A card is wrong
 * where the word is *known* to take the outside trio, by Ekilex's own
 * classification or by the `-maa` ending, and the case asked for is an inside
 * one.
 *
 * Here rather than in `lib/srs/retire.ts` because this module and `place.ts`
 * are the only two allowed to decide which set of local cases a word takes,
 * which is asserted: a second module answering it is how the original fault
 * reached eight generators.
