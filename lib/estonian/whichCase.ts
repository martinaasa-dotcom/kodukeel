/**
 * WHICH CASE A LEARNER JUST WROTE, WHERE EXACTLY ONE CASE SPELLS IT THAT WAY.
 *
 * The inverse of `caseAnswer`, and it lives beside the table it inverts for
 * the reason `possibleFirstPersons` lives beside the ending table it reads
 * backwards: a rule read one way in one module and the other way in another is
 * two rules the day somebody edits one of them.
 *
 * It exists because "you did not use the form we asked for" is the least
 * useful true thing this app can say. A learner asked for `majas` who wrote
 * `majast` has made one specific mistake, has a good reason for it, and can be
 * told what they wrote instead in one line. Nothing else in the app could
 * answer that: every other screen compares against one form and stops.
 *
 * ONE RULE, AND IT IS DELIBERATELY THE STRICT ONE. A case is named only when
 * it is the only case that spells the word that way. That is the same
 * discipline `lib/estonian/gapForms.ts` states about the principal parts, and
 * generalizing it is what makes it correct rather than nearly correct: `tuba`
 * is its own nominative and its own partitive, so neither may be named, while
 * `raamatu` is only ever the omastav and naming it teaches something. A rule
 * that skipped the principal parts wholesale would lose `raamatu`, and a rule
 * that named the first match would call a partitive object a subject, which is
 * the fault the level check was shipped with.
 *
 * THE SHORT ILLATIVE IS WHY THIS CANNOT BE A SUFFIX TABLE READ BACKWARDS.
 * 1,937 of the 2,700 short illatives in the shipped dictionary are spelled
 * like the nominative, the genitive or the partitive, because that is what the
 * aditiiv does. Reading endings off a word would call every one of those an
 * illative. Building the whole singular from the entry and looking for
 * collisions is the only version that gets `aadressi` right.
 *
 * Pure. `caseAnswer` prefers an attested form over a derived one, so an
 * enriched entry is answered from what a lexicographer wrote and a seeded one
 * from the suffix rule, and neither is invented (ADR-005 amendment 1).

    the partitive plural of `käsi` is spelled like its nominative, and the
    nominative plural of `pea` like its partitive. Measured over the shipped
    dictionary, 164 spellings, and each was named as the singular case, which
    reports a plural subject as an object on every screen that names one.

    Only as a collision, never as a claim of its own: a plural spelled like
    no singular stays unknown, exactly as before, because the screens reading
    this give a plural no frame and a new "one" here would hand them one. The
    plural obliques are a stored genitive plural plus the case's own ending,
