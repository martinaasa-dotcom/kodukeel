/**
 * Every spelling of one word that could be the gap in a sentence.
 *
 * A GAP-FILL IS BUILT OUT OF A SENTENCE SOMEBODY RECORDED, AND THE WORD IN IT
 * IS INFLECTED.
 *
 * `buildCloze` hides a word it is told to look for, so what it can hide is
 * whatever list the caller hands it, and there were five such lists. Two of
 * them (`lesson.ts`, `checkpoint.ts`) already added the ten regular cases and
 * were the same twenty lines twice. Three did not: the review card, the
 * printable worksheet, and the mock exam, and the worksheet's own comment says
 * "a sentence about `tuba` usually contains `toas`, not `tuba`, and hiding the
 * inflected form is the more useful exercise" over a list that could not hide
 * `toas` unless Ekilex happened to have stored it. None of the five knew a
 * verb person at all, so `Kontsert algab kell 18.` could not be gapped for
 * `algama` and `Kuidas sa elad?` could not be gapped for `elama`, which are
 * the two commonest shapes in the language.
 *
 * Measured over the graded half of the shipped dictionary: 2,201 words could
 * carry a gap and 2,758 can now, a quarter more, on sentences the dictionary
 * already held.
 *
 * NOTHING IS INVENTED, AND THE SENTENCE IS THE SECOND OPINION. Every spelling
 * here is a stored form or one of the two derivations ADR-005 amendment 1
 * allows, and a derived form only ever becomes a card by matching a word a
 * lexicographer wrote in a real sentence. A wrong derivation matches nothing
 * and disappears; a right one is confirmed by the sentence it was found in.
 *
 * Pure, like the two modules it unions.

    A PRINCIPAL PART IS NOT LABELED, AND NOR IS A SHORT ILLATIVE SPELLED LIKE
    ONE.

    `tuba` is its own nominative and its own partitive, so a card built on it
    cannot say which case the sentence was using it in, and the label is what
    the accuracy chart counts: a guess there is a wrong row rather than a
    missing one.

    `ILL_SG_SHORT` was the exception, on the argument that the dictionary only
    promotes it where it differs from all three principal parts. That is not
    what the dictionary holds. Measured over the shipped file, **1,934 of the
    2,700 entries that store a short illative store one spelled exactly like a
    principal part**, which is the same figure `lib/estonian/derive.ts` quotes
    the other way round when it says the case does this to most words: `arsti`
    is the short illative of `arst` and also its genitive and its partitive.
    The old rule left the label to whichever row the database happened to
    return first, since the first writer wins below, so `Läksin ____ juurde.`
    gapped for a genitive could be written into the append-only log as an
    illative.

    So the strict rule the gap rung already states applies here too: exactly
    one slot claims the spelling, or no slot is named. The form is still
    gappable, because it is a real form of the word; what it no longer does is
    claim a case it shares with another.

    A retrieved form names its own slot, which is what `morphCode` is.
