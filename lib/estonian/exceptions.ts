/**
 * WHERE THE PATTERN STOPS BEING TRUE.
 *
 * This app teaches Estonian the way a class does: three principal parts, then
 * eleven endings on the genitive stem. That is the single most motivating fact
 * a beginner is given, and `lib/estonian/derive.ts` is built on it. It is also
 * the thing a learner gets burned by, because the app never said where it stops
 * holding. `caseAnswer` quietly prefers an attested form over the rule, so the
 * screen is right and the *model in the learner's head* is wrong: they see
 * `tuppa` printed under a heading that told them the ending is `sse`, and
 * nothing on the page says which of those two facts to trust next time.
 *
 * There are two places it stops.
 *
 * FIRST, GETTING TO THE STEM. `tuba : toa`, `aeg : aja`, `aken : akna`,
 * `asi : asja`. No rule in the language reaches the genitive from the
 * nominative: the consonant center grades, or a vowel drops out of the middle,
 * or the stem is simply another word. Everything else in the table is built on
 * that stem, so a learner who guesses it wrong gets all eleven cases wrong at
 * once. This is the exception that costs the most and it is the one the
 * dictionary was least willing to talk about, since the entry printed
 * `astmevaheldus mm : mb` as a chip and left it there.
 *
 * SECOND, THE SLOTS THE ENDING RULE DOES NOT REACH. The short illative
 * (`tuppa`, not `toasse`), the partitive singular, the genitive plural, the
 * short partitive plural, a suppletive or absent nominative plural, and on the
 * verb the present stem, the simple past, the `da`-infinitive, the `tud`
 * participle and the polite imperative.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A LIST OF WORDS. A hand-written table of exceptions would be
 * this app writing Estonian, and the first misspelling in it would ship in
 * silence and be drilled (ADR-005). So this module states, for each slot, the
 * pattern a course actually teaches, and reports every word whose stored form
 * disagrees with it. Delete every Estonian word from the comments in this file
 * and its output is identical: what it holds is suffixes, which is the same
 * latitude `cases.ts` and `conjugate.ts` already take, and the illative's is
 * read off `CASES` rather than typed, because an ending spelled twice is two
 * endings waiting to disagree.
 *
 * AND THE COPY IS HELD TO THE SAME RULE, WHICH IT WAS NOT. `KIND_NOTES` named
 * three verbs by their first person and one of the three was wrong: the
 * everyday verb for must governs the *other* infinitive, which is the one
 * thing `TOPIC_NOTES.infinitives` puts under "watch out". Nothing re-checked
 * them, because the header above was about the rules and the notes are copy,
 * so the fault shipped and was then taught to everybody who met the kind. The
 * notes name endings and nothing else now: a governing verb is described by
 * meaning and named once on the page `KindNote.topic` points at, and
 * `exceptions.test.ts` fails on a note carrying a stored first person out of
 * the shipped dictionary, which is what would have caught it.
 *
 * SILENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE, which is the rule `lib/srs/retire.ts` was corrected
 * for. A word the dictionary holds no form for is unknown, never regular: every
 * test below runs only where the stored form is actually there, so a thin entry
 * reports nothing rather than reporting that it behaves.
 *
 * AND NO SCREEN PRINTS WHAT THE PATTERN WOULD HAVE GIVEN, except where that is
 * also a real word. `toasse` is correct Estonian and is accepted everywhere the
 * short illative is shown, so it can be shown as the other half of a pair. The
 * partitive the ending rule would build for `aeg` is not a word at all, and
 * putting it on a screen with a line through it is this app writing Estonian
 * and hoping nobody memorizes it. `ruleForm` carries it for the audit, which is
 * read by whoever maintains the rules; `ruleFormIsAlsoRight` is what a screen
 * asks before printing one.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma.

    puts the vowel back that the singular dropped, so a learner who has the

      Estonian somebody typed ships in silence and is then drilled.

      So the governing verbs are given by meaning here and named, once, on the
      page `topic` points at, where `lib/estonian/grammar.ts` already had them
      right and holds no Estonian either. `exceptions.test.ts` checks these
      notes against the dictionary's own stored first persons, so the next verb
      typed in fails rather than ships.
