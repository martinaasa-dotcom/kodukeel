/**
 * Marking a dictation.
 *
 * Typing back a sentence you have only heard is the hardest thing the app asks
 * for, and the only exercise that tests listening, spelling and word boundaries
 * at once — Estonian runs its case endings straight onto the stem, so hearing
 * `toas` and writing `toa` is a real and specific failure rather than a slip.
 *
 * Which is exactly why a single right/wrong verdict would be useless. A learner
 * who got eleven words out of twelve needs to see *which* one, and whether they
 * missed the word or only its diacritics. So this aligns what was typed against
 * what was said, word by word, and labels each pairing.
 *
 * Alignment is Needleman–Wunsch rather than a naive zip: drop one word early in
 * a sentence and every later word shifts, so zipping would mark a nearly
 * perfect answer as entirely wrong. Sentences are a dozen words at most, so the
 * quadratic table costs nothing.
 *
 * Nothing here writes Estonian. It compares a typed string against a sentence
 * that came from Ekilex (ADR-005).

/**
 * What went wrong with one word, in words.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THIS EXERCISE EXISTS FOR WAS IN A TOOLTIP.
 *
 * `diacritics` and `typo` are the whole pedagogical claim of dictation: the
 * README promises the marking shows "whether you only lost its Estonian
 * letters", and that is a different lesson from a slipped finger. They were
 * rendered identically — same background, same ink, same "you: ‹typed›" line —
 * and told apart only by a `title` attribute, which is a hover tooltip. On a
 * phone, which is the device this app is measured on, hover does not happen,
 * so on the primary device the exercise's headline distinction was invisible.
 *
 * The main review flow already had this right: `checkAnswer` produces a
 * sentence and `ReviewSession` prints it. This is that, per word, and it
 * reuses `droppedDiacritics` rather than rewriting the loop, so the two
 * cannot drift apart on which letters they know about.
 *
 * `wrong`, `missing` and `extra` return null on purpose. What is already on
 * screen — the word that was expected, the word that was typed, "left out",
 * the strikethrough — says everything a label would, and a chip that explains
 * an obvious mistake at length is a chip nobody reads.
 *
 * Nothing here writes Estonian: every letter named comes out of the sentence
 * Ekilex recorded (ADR-005).
