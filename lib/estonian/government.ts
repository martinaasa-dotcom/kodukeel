 * allative where English "call you" suggests a direct object. No amount of
 * exposure fixes it; it has to be drilled per verb.

 * which is right for display and useless for a drill. This turns it into
 * something answerable without a second source of truth: the case is parsed out,

 * who knew `see ei aita millestki` picked the elative and was told they were
