/**
 * A GROUP SEEN BY WHOEVER IS PAYING FOR IT, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME SEAT AS A
 * TEACHER'S.
 *
 * A class and a sponsored group of colleagues are the same rows underneath:
 * people who joined something, each with their own deck and their own review
 * log, none of it copied anywhere. What differs is who is looking and what they
 * have a reason to know.
 *
 * `lib/classroom/roster.ts` already drew that line once, for a teacher, and
 * widened it once deliberately: a teacher sees which case one named student
 * keeps missing, on the argument that the aggregate told them the class was
 * weak on the partitive and nothing about who to sit next to. That argument is
 * a pedagogical one and it does not survive being moved into a workplace. An
 * employer has no lesson to plan. What they have is a budget they are spending
 * and a date their employee has to pass an examination by, and "Kadri keeps
 * getting the partitive wrong" answers neither question while being exactly the
 * kind of thing that follows somebody into a review they cannot see.
 *
 * So a workplace cohort is not the teacher's roster with fields hidden in the
 * view. It is a narrower query that never reads the per-person case data at
 * all, feeding a shape that has nowhere to put it. A field that is not in the
 * type cannot be printed by the next screen somebody writes.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock beyond what the caller passes in. The
 * database half is `workplaceRoster` in lib/classroom/roster.ts.
