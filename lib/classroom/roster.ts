/**
 * What a teacher needs to see about a class, in three queries rather than three
 * per student.
 *
 * The shape of this is a deliberate limit on what a class exposes. A teacher
 * sees effort and progress — reviews this week, streak, words known, which
 * grammar case a student personally keeps missing — and nothing else. Not
 * what a student looked up, not their deck, not their answers one by one. A
 * classroom tool that turned into surveillance would be a worse product and a
 * worse thing to build.
 *
 * The per-student weak case is a widening of that boundary, made deliberately
 * rather than by drift. The line was originally "aggregate across the class,
 * never attributed to one student", on the argument that "the group is weak
 * on the partitive" is a lesson plan and "Kadri is" is a pillory. That is
 * still true of a raw mistake, which is why this stays a rolled-up percentage
 * over a student's own reviews at a case, gated on `MIN_STUDENT_CASE_REVIEWS`
 * so one bad card is never enough to name somebody, and why it is still never
 * an individual answer, a search or a deck. What changed is the judgment
 * that a teacher who already sees a name, a streak and a word count is not
 * meaningfully better protected by having the one actionable fact, which case
 * to help with, withheld along with it: the aggregate alone told a teacher
 * *that* the class struggles with the partitive and nothing about *who* to
 * help, which is the harder problem in a room of twenty-five.

        `evidenceFrom` reads two things, the count and how many skills have been

        somebody whose whole history is older than the window still lands on
        "thin" here whatever their lifetime count, and their own hub may say
        more. That is the honest answer rather than a fault to route around: a
        band is a claim about what somebody can do now, and there is nothing
        recent to make it out of. What the all-time count buys is that an
