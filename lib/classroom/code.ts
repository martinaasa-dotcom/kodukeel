/**
 * Class join codes.
 *
 * A code is written on a board, read out loud, and typed by thirty people on
 * their phones, so the alphabet leaves out every character that gets misread:
 * no O/0, no I/1/L, no U/V. What is left is 29 symbols, and six of them give
 * around 600 million codes — collisions are a non-issue at any plausible scale,
 * and the generator checks the database anyway.
 *
 * Note what normalization deliberately does *not* do: guess. It uppercases and
 * drops the spaces and dashes people add themselves, and stops there. Mapping a
 * mistyped `0` onto `Q` would risk quietly putting a student in the wrong
 * class, which is far worse than telling them the code was not found.
 *
 * Pure, so the rules are testable without a database.
