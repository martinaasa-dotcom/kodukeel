/**
 * EVERY THING THIS APP RUNS ON, DECLARED ONCE, WITH ITS PRICE.
 *
 * There used to be three lists. A catalog said what the app depends on, a
 * set of hand-written functions in the cost model said what each one costs,
 * and the page rendered whichever of them it had been told about. Adding a
 * service meant remembering all three, and the one certain to go stale is the
 * bill: nothing fails when a line is missing from a total, it just comes out
 * lower than the truth, which is the single worst way for a page like this to
 * be wrong.
 *
 * So this is the list. A service carries what it is, who runs it, what a
 * learner loses without it, the variable that switches it on, where its price
 * came from, and a function that says what it costs at a given size. Adding a
 * new tool is one entry here and nothing else: the bill, the totals, the
 * chart, the ladder and the page's own description all read this array, and
 * `scripts/test-invariants.ts` fails if any of them stops.
 *
 * NO SERVICE ANYBODY BILLS US FOR IS MODELED AS FREE. A free tier is a plan
 * that pauses when nobody is on it, forbids commercial use, or hands out an
 * allowance the day somebody launches, and modeling one made this page
 * cheerful and wrong. Every vendor here is on the plan a real deployment is on.
 *
 * WHAT IS GIVEN IS CREDITED, NOT PRICED. Ekilex, Wiktionary and TartuNLP are
 * public institutions that have decided this work should be available. They
 * ask for nothing. An earlier version put a shadow price on them and added it
 * to the total, which turns a thing to be grateful for into a line on an
 * invoice nobody sent. They are `given` instead: named, with what each one
 * provides and the licence it comes under, and kept out of every total. Where
 * there is a commercial equivalent, the page says what buying the same thing
 * would come to, so the size of the gift is visible without being charged for.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, and no environment. Which of these a
 * particular deployment has switched on is read by the page.
