/**
 * What this app costs to run, and how anybody knows.
 *
 * Three kinds of number live here and they are kept apart on purpose.
 *
 * `MEASURED` is what a stopwatch, `pg_total_relation_size` and a browser said
 * about this repository on a stated day. Every entry carries the command that
 * produced it, so a reader who doubts one can re-run it rather than take our
 * word, and so the next person to change the schema or the bundle can see
 * which figure they have just invalidated.
 *
 * `VERCEL`, `SUPABASE`, `COMPUTE`, `SPEECH_MARKET` and `DOMAIN` are somebody
 * else's published prices, each with the page it came off and the day it was
 * read. They are not facts about this app at all and they date faster than
 * anything else here, which is why they are quoted with a date rather than
 * folded into the arithmetic.
 *
 * `ASSUMPTIONS` is everything left: what the projection needs and nothing
 * measured. It is deliberately short, and every entry is on the page in full
 * with the reason it is the number it is.
 *
 * WHAT IS GIVEN IS NOT PRICED HERE. Ekilex, Wiktionary and TartuNLP ask for
 * nothing and are credited in `services.ts` rather than billed. The one figure
 * kept for them is `SPEECH_MARKET`, and it is there to show the size of the
 * gift rather than to charge for it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE HAS A FREE TIER. Earlier versions of this file carried one for
 * Vercel and one for Supabase and picked between them by traffic, which
 * described a deployment nobody actually runs: a free plan pauses when nobody
 * is on it, forbids commercial use, and is not what anybody hosting this for
 * other people is on. Modeling it made the page cheerful and wrong. The paid
 * plan is the only plan.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma.
