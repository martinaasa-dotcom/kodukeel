/**
 * WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS WHEN THE MONEY STOPS.
 *
 * The page next door says what the app costs and where every figure came
 * from, which answers the question a funder asks first. It does not answer the
 * one they score: what becomes of the thing they paid for once they stop
 * paying for it. A project that can only answer "it stops" is asking for a
 * subscription rather than a grant, and a project that answers "it will be
 * self-sustaining" without arithmetic is guessing at somebody else's expense.
 *
 * So this is the arithmetic, and it is read off the same registry as
 * everything else. `services.ts` already records, per service, what a learner
 * loses when it goes: that field was written for the infrastructure page and
 * is exactly the raw material for this one. A retrenchment stage names service
 * ids, the bill is recomputed by the same `billFor` that draws the cost
 * explorer, and what is lost at each step is quoted from the service itself.
 * There is still one list.
 *
 * THE SHAPE OF THE ANSWER, WHICH IS UNUSUAL AND IS WHY IT IS WORTH WRITING
 * DOWN. Most of what this app is made of is given rather than bought. The
 * dictionary is Ekilex, the speech is TartuNLP, the English glosses are
 * Wiktionary, and all three are public institutions that have decided this
 * work should be available. The scheduler, the exams, the games, the grammar
 * and the whole course run on nothing but a server and a database. What money
 * buys here is the tutor, the tooling that writes the app, and the polish. So
 * the floor is low and the fall is gradual, and the honest claim is not that
 * the project becomes profitable but that it becomes cheap enough to keep
 * alive without anybody being paid.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma, no environment. Like the rest of the
 * directory.

/**
 * One step down, cumulative with every step above it.
 *

 * renamed or removed cannot leave a stage quietly claiming a saving it no
 * longer makes. An invariant checks every id names a real service.
