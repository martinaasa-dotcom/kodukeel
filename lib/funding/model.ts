/**
 * What a month of this app costs, at whatever size somebody puts in.
 *
 * The point of writing this down as arithmetic rather than as a sentence is
 * that a sentence cannot be argued with. Every input is on the page, every
 * assumption is named, and a reader who thinks fifteen reviews a day is wrong
 * for their class can move it and watch the bill move. A funder reading "it
 * costs about seventy dollars a month" has to trust us; a funder who can see
 * which line grows fastest and where the next cliff is does not have to.
 *
 * THIS MODULE NAMES NO SERVICE. It works out how much of everything a month
 * contains and then asks each entry in `services.ts` what that costs. Adding a
 * new tool is one entry there, and the bill, the totals, the chart and the
 * page all pick it up, because none of them holds a list of its own.
 *
 * THREE KINDS OF NUMBER GO IN, AND THEY ARE NOT EQUALLY SOLID.
 *
 *   Measured      `facts.ts`, taken off this repository on a stated day.
 *   Published     `facts.ts`, off a vendor's own pricing page on a stated day.
 *   Assumed       `ASSUMPTIONS` in `facts.ts`, and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT MODEL. Anybody's time, which is the largest
 * real cost of this project and is not a hosting bill. Support, which is a
 * person. Whether a bigger database instance is needed for a reason other than
 * memory or connections, which it often is. A month with a launch in it. The
 * page says all of that out loud rather than letting a total imply it is
 * complete.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma.
