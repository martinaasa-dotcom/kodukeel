/**
 * FOUR FORMS OF ONE WORD, ONE OF THEM THE ONE THE SENTENCE WANTS.
 *
 * A case card used to end in "Not yet" and "Got it": the app held the answer
 * character for character, could have marked it, and asked the learner to mark
 * it instead. That judgment then went into `Review`, the append-only log, and
 * the weakest-case panel, the mastery counter, the readiness rungs and the exam
 * confidence figure are all derived from it. The daily quest is the sharp end
 * of that, because it picks the cases a learner is worst at and then lets them
 * mark their own paper on exactly those.
 *
 * Typing is the strongest answer and is what `/review` asks for. It is not
 * what a two-minute round can ask for, and the argument the quest makes about
 * itself is sound: volume across a weakness beats depth on one card. What was
 * never true is that self-grading is the only alternative. Picking one of four
 * is a tap, exactly as "Got it" is a tap, and it is a measurement.
 *
 * THE WRONG ANSWERS ARE THIS WORD'S OTHER CASES, which is why this needs no
 * pool and no query. `toast`, `toasse` and `toale` against `toas` is the
 * confusion the round exists for, and a learner who reaches for the seestütlev
 * has said something about themselves that "Not yet" could never have said:
 * `Review.reachedSlot` records which form they went for, and a flip can never
 * populate it because a flip never learns what they were thinking.
 *
 * `formNearness` is the ranking the mock exam and the level check already use
 * for a form, and its own comment describes this pool: the three principal
 * parts sort low because `tuba` beside `toas` is answered on the first two
 * letters, where the oblique cases all have to be read to the end.
 *
 * Pure, and it writes nothing: every option is `caseAnswer`'s output for a
 * case of this word, which is an attested form or the one derivation over a
 * stored stem that ADR-005 amendment 1 allows.

    `alsoRight`, and `alsoRight` is null wherever a case has more than two
    attested spellings. Ekilex records three elatives for `kodu`, so on
    `kodu → seestütlev` the answer was `kodust` and `kodunt` was eligible as a
    decoy: an attested elative offered as the wrong ending, which is exactly
    the fault the paragraph below says this may never commit.

    AND A DISTRACTOR IS A WORD, NOT A SPELLING WE WOULD ACCEPT. `accepted`
    holds the suffix guess beside the form a lexicographer recorded, and
    `derive.ts` says printing that guess "would assert the guess is a real
    word". It is the right list to mark against and the wrong one to print, so
