/*
  THE WRONG ANSWERS.

  A multiple choice question is exactly as hard as its second best option, and
  this test had no second best option. `choices` took whatever the shuffle
  handed back first out of every gloss in the dictionary, so a beginner asked
  what `must` means chose between "black", "plastic bag", "narcomania, drug
  addiction, substance abuse" and "user experience". Three of those can be
  crossed out by somebody who has never seen an Estonian word in their life:
  two are C1 nouns out of a corner of the dictionary an A1 question has no
  business in, and one runs to three senses where the answer is one word. What
  that question measures is whether the reader can spot the odd option, and
  nobody is placed at A2 for that.

  It matters more here than anywhere else in the app. A placement check is ten
  minutes long and every question it asks is load bearing, so a question that
  can be answered by elimination is a question that measured nothing and a
  level built on four of them is wrong about somebody's Estonian on the day
  they are deciding where to start.

  So a wrong answer is chosen for how near it is to the right one. Near means
  what a learner cannot use to eliminate it: the same part of speech, the same
  CEFR band, the same shape on the page, and, where the course teaches the
  word, the same unit, which is how "black" ends up beside "white", "gray" and
  "brown" rather than beside a plastic bag. For a case it means the cases that
  answer the same question word, since `kus?` is answered by two of them and
  telling those two apart is the whole of what the question asks.

  The one thing nearness may never do is produce a second right answer. Every
  pick is still filtered by the caller's own test of what counts as the same
  answer, and that test got stricter as the options got closer, not looser:
  `sameMeaning` for a gloss, and for a sentence a containment rule, because
  two recorded usages that share every content word are two ways of saying one
  thing and a learner picking either of them is right.

  Three callers read it and that is why it lives here rather than inside any
  one of them: the placement check (`lib/assessment/items.ts`), the mock exam
  (`lib/exam/paper.ts`) and `buildOptions` in `lib/estonian/government.ts`,
  which is the one table of what cases to offer against a governed one and is
  shared by the exam and the government practice mode. A copy per caller is
  three answers to one question, drifting a weight at a time, which is the
  argument `lib/cache/singleFlight.ts` makes about itself.

  Pure, and it holds no Estonian of its own: every gloss, form and sentence it
  sorts was read out of the dictionary by the caller, and a case reaches it as
  a `CaseSpec` from `lib/estonian/cases.ts`. The CEFR ladder comes from
  `lib/assessment/types.ts`, which is where this app declares it.
