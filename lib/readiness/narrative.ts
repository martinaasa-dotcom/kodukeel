 * WHAT A RUNG SAYS, IN WORDS, AND THERE IS ONE COPY OF IT.

 * Two screens print a reading, the list and the detail, and Progress prints
 * the summary, so the sentences live beside the arithmetic rather than in
 * either page. A verdict here is the honest version of the claim, kind where
 * the news is bad and never vague about it: "you would be lost here" is what
 * somebody sitting a real exchange finds out in the first ten seconds, and
 * hearing it from the app first is the kinder order.
 *
 * Nothing here is a hedge dressed as a verdict. The tier is printed as its own
 * words (`EVIDENCE_LABEL`, shared with the exam hub so one word means one
 * thing) and the verdict says what the rung is, so a reader sees both.
