/**
 * THE SITUATIONS A LEARNER IS ASKED HOW READY THEY ARE FOR.
 *
 * "You would understand 81 percent of everyday situations" is the number a
 * vocabulary app can compute and it answers the least useful question. Knowing
 * the words for a health center is what lets you follow the receptionist. It
 * is not what lets you answer her, and it is nothing like what lets you open
 * the exchange, steer it and recover when she says one sentence too fast. Most
 * apps sell the first as the third, and the person who believed them finds out
 * at the counter.
 *
 * So the unit of readiness here is the **situation**, and each one is read on
 * three rungs: could you follow it, could you take part in it, could you lead
 * it (`rungs.ts`). The situations are the course's own promises. Every unit in
 * `lib/collections/syllabus/` carries a `canDo` claim, phrased the way the
 * CEFR phrases one, and not one of the 82 had ever been checked against what
 * the learner has actually done. This table is what turns each claim into a
 * question the review log can answer.
 *
 * WHAT IS AUTHORED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT. Everything in this file is English,
 * which is the one language this project may write (ADR-005), and it holds
 * no Estonian at all: a situation names a **unit id**, never a word, exactly
 * as `lib/collections/topical.ts` names units rather than words for the
 * seasonal row. The words come out of the course, where a lemma is already a
 * request the Ekilex harvest either honored or reported. The cases a
 * situation turns on are keys of `CASES`, so a typo fails a test rather than
 * silently asking about nothing. `situations.test.ts` checks both.
 *
 * WHAT THE FACTS ARE FOR. `live` says whether this is an exchange with another
 * person in real time, which is where pace and the ear matter, or something
 * done at your own speed with a dictionary open, where they do not; a reading
 * unit is never told its listening is untested. `needs` names the machinery
 * every conversation runs on, question words, numbers, the clock, the words
 * for yes and no, and a situation that hinges on one of them is held to it on
 * the top rung: nobody leads a shop encounter who cannot follow a price said
 * once. `cases` are the endings the encounter actually turns on, so the
 * struggle list can say "the alalütlev, which is how you say something hurts"
 * rather than "grammar". `tryThis` is the encouraging half and the point of
 * the whole screen: a real thing to go and do, offered only once the log says
 * the learner could take part. `expect` is what will come back at you, so the
 * first fast reply is not the first time anybody mentioned it.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no Prisma, no clock.
