/**
 * THREE RUNGS, AND WHAT EACH ONE COSTS TO CLAIM.
 *
 * A situation is read on three rungs, in order, and a learner is placed on the
 * highest one the log will actually support:
 *
 *   follow      You would understand most of what is said to you. This is the
 *               rung a vocabulary percentage measures, and it is the lowest.
 *   take part   You could answer when spoken to, with the words and the
 *               endings the encounter needs, without a long silence first.
 *   lead        You could open it, steer it and recover when it goes wrong.
 *
 * Under those, `lost` is a situation the learner has met and is not yet able
 * to follow, and `unmet` is one whose words the log has never seen at all,
 * which is a fact about the course rather than about the learner and is
 * printed as one.
 *
 * WHAT EACH RUNG READS. Follow is recognition: the word came at you and you
 * knew it. Take part is production: the meaning, the case or the person was
 * asked for and you gave it, more than once, and got it right the last time.
 * Lead is production with variety and at pace, plus everything the encounter
 * leans on that is not its own vocabulary: the cases it turns on, the
 * machinery it runs on (numbers, question words, the clock), and, for a live
 * exchange, some evidence that the learner can follow *speech*, which is the
 * one thing the review log cannot supply on its own.
 *
 * THE ONE PROMISE. Recognition alone never clears the second rung. A learner
 * who has turned over every card in a unit and never produced a word of it is
 * at `follow`, whatever the percentage, because that is what they can do. The
 * invariant suite asserts it, and `rungs.test.ts` was made to fail on it.
 *
 * THE BARS ARE SHARES OF WORDS, NOT AVERAGES OF SCORES. A situation is read
 * word by word and then asks how many of its words stand at each rung, since
 * an average lets three words you know cold cover four you have never met,
 * and an encounter does not: the one word you are missing is the one the
 * other person says. Three quarters to follow, six in ten to take part, six
 * in ten at lead with eight in ten at take part underneath it. Round figures
 * rather than fitted ones, and they are meant to be: what they encode is
 * that "most" is the bar for understanding and "most, reliably" is the bar
 * for speaking, and the tier printed beside every reading is what keeps the
 * exact boundary honest.
 *
 * THIN EVIDENCE CAPS THE RUNG. The exam model caps a *confidence* at what the
 * log has earned (`lib/exam/readiness.ts`); here there is no percentage to
 * cap, so the rung itself is capped. Under a dozen answers on a situation's
 * words the app will say follow and no more, whatever they were; under forty
 * it will say take part and no more. The reading names the cap when it bites,
 * because "take part" that means "take part, on eleven answers" is a
 * different sentence from the same words on two hundred.
 *
 * Pure. No React, no Prisma, no clock beyond what the caller passes in.
