/**
 * The spend cap, against the database, because the thing that was wrong with it
 * could only be wrong against a database.
 *
 * `authoriseCall` used to read four aggregates, return a verdict, and leave the
 * row to be written when the call finished. That is a check-then-act race, and
 * on a streamed answer the gap between the two is the length of the answer: ten
 * requests could each read the same "under the limit" and each go ahead. No
 * unit test can see that, because the fault is entirely in what two connections
 * do at once.
 *
 * So these run concurrently on purpose. The first is the one that matters and
 * it fails against the old shape.
