 * is a paid model again and sign-up is open, so an unmetered path is now one
 * stranger away from an unbounded invoice.
 *
 * Three limits, because they fail in different ways:
 *   - a burst limit stops a runaway client or a held-down key,
 *   - a per-user daily limit stops one enthusiastic person monopolizing the key,
 *   - a global daily cost cap is the actual guarantee about the bill.

 * The whole product works with no AI at all: review, the dictionary, every
 * drill, the writing exercise's actual verdict, offline. What costs money per
 * use is Anu and the other side of a rehearsed conversation, so those are the
 * parts with an allowance. Ten conversations a day is enough to understand
 * what Anu is for and not enough for anyone to run up a bill with. The number
 * is the base; `lib/usage/ledger` scales it per kind, because a grader note, a
 * cache miss on speech and one turn of a conversation are not the same thing
 * as a tutoring answer.
 *
 * THE SHARED CEILING IS A MONTHLY BUDGET DIVIDED BY A MONTH, and it used to be
 * $20 a day, which is $600 a month and was never a figure anybody had decided
 * to spend. It is $5 a month now, stated as the daily figure the ledger
 * actually compares against, because a cap expressed in the unit it is checked
 * in is a cap somebody can reason about. Measured against the prompts this
 * repository builds (`npm run measure:compose`, priced at claude-sonnet-5),
 * that is about five rehearsed conversations and fourteen questions to Anu a
 * day once scene composition has yielded its half (docs/21-situations.md §42).
 *
 * It is a **default** and not a policy: a deployment with more money sets
 * `AI_DAILY_USD_GLOBAL`, and a fork inheriting this inherits a small bill
 * rather than a surprising one, which is the right way round for a number
 * nobody has looked at yet.
 *
 * AND THE PER-USER SPEND CAP MATCHES IT RATHER THAN SITTING ABOVE IT. It was
 * $0.50, which was a fortieth of the old ceiling and is three times the new
 * one: a limit above the limit it sits inside can never bite, so it would have
 * been a stated control doing nothing, which is worse than no control because
 * a reader counts it. At this budget what rations one person is the call count
 * and the reserve below, not a second money cap, so one learner may spend the
 * day and the reserve is what keeps the last quarter of it for somebody who
 * has not asked anything yet. That is what the reserve was written for, and on
 * a deployment with one learner it means their own budget is not half wasted.
