 * nothing:
 *
 *   TUTOR   the expensive one, and the one worth rationing. A full answer over
 *           a long conversation, at the base allowance.
 *   GRADER  a few hundred tokens about one sentence. The verdict a learner
 *           acts on is decided by string comparison against the dictionary
 *           before any of this runs, so what is rationed here is only the note
 *           that comes after it. Thirty of those is a real practice session.
 *   TTS     free, cached on disk and in Supabase Storage, and joined when two
 *           requests for the same clip are in flight. Only a miss reaches
 *           here at all. A listening round legitimately meets a dozen new
 *           words in a minute, so a tight cap would break a real session to
 *           solve a problem that does not exist.
 *   SCENE    one turn of one conversation. This said "booked whole rather than
 *           per turn" and described a design two changes ago: the booking is
 *           per turn, because two of the three limits count `CALL` rows and a
 *           dozen turns behind one booking is eleven calls the allowance never
 *           saw. At the base allowance that arithmetic left a learner ten
 *           turns a day, and a scene is 6.5 beats plus the curveballs its
 *           difficulty raises, so on a deployment that composes every turn the
 *           first conversation of the day ran the allowance out somewhere in
 *           the middle of itself. Four times the base is three or four whole
 *           conversations, which is a real evening; the burst stays at the
 *           base, because a turn is somebody typing a sentence and eight a
 *           minute is already faster than anybody talks. What rations the
 *           money is still the deployment's daily budget rather than this
 *           count, and at the measured cost of a turn it binds first.
 *   SCAN     one photograph read once. It is the dearest single call in the
 *           app, because a picture is a few thousand input tokens where a
 *           question is a few hundred, but it is also the least repeated: a
 *           page is scanned once and then studied for weeks. Twice the base
 *           covers a whole workbook chapter in a sitting.
 *
 * Everything stays free at every one of these numbers. They exist so that one
 * enthusiastic person cannot spend the day's budget before anyone else arrives.

    TWO STATEMENTS, BECAUSE THIS RUNS INSIDE THE LOCK.

    `authoriseCall` holds a deployment-wide advisory lock across this, and
    Prisma queues every query of an interactive transaction on that
    transaction's single connection: a `Promise.all` there is sequential round
    trips, not concurrent ones. So each count is lock-held latency multiplied
    by every AI call the whole deployment is making, and this was four of them
    before a release had to be counted and would have been eight after.

    Postgres does the counting instead. Seven of the eight numbers are over one
    owner's rows for one day, which is one index scan and a handful of `FILTER`
    clauses; the eighth is everybody's spend and is a different `where`, so it
    stays its own statement. Two, where it was four before any of this.

    A call that was handed back is not a call, which is why each kind is
    counted rather than filtered out: `CALL` minus `RELEASE` keeps both numbers
    something a person can look up in the table by hand when a limit surprises
    somebody.

 * Whether this call may proceed, and the reservation that says it did.

 * point of the cap is the case where something is wrong, and "the database
 * hiccuped" is not a reason to start spending without a limit.
 *
 * THE READ AND THE WRITE ARE ONE OPERATION, WHICH THEY WERE NOT.
 *
 * This used to read four aggregates, return a verdict, and leave the actual
 * ledger row to be written when the call finished. For a streamed answer on a
 * route allowed two minutes, that gap is the length of the answer. Ten tabs,
 * a retry loop or a script all read the same "under the limit" inside it and
 * all went ahead, and the limit that was supposed to be the hard backstop on
 * the whole deployment's bill was the one with the widest window of the three.
 *
 * So the call is written down at the moment it is authorized, at an estimate,
 * inside the same transaction that read the counters — and that transaction
 * takes an advisory lock first, because two transactions reading before either
 * writes is the same race with a smaller window rather than none. The lock is
 * held across two aggregates and one insert, which is milliseconds, and never
 * across the model call itself. It is deployment-wide on purpose: the global
 * budget is a deployment-wide number, and a per-user lock would leave exactly
 * the limit that matters most unprotected.
 *
 * A *transaction* advisory lock rather than a session one, which is what makes
 * it safe behind a connection pooler: it is released when the transaction ends,
 * whichever backend served it, so a pooler handing the next statement to a
 * different session cannot strand it. The blocking form, because the
 * non-blocking one serializes nothing — that was tried first and twelve
 * concurrent authorizations all sailed through it, which is the bug this is
 * here to fix wearing a lock as a hat.
 *
 * `lock_timeout` is set so waiting has a floor under it. If the lock cannot be
 * had in three seconds something is badly wrong upstream, and the right answer
 * then is the fail-closed path below — a refusal a learner can retry — rather
 * than a request that hangs until the platform kills it.
