    account: a deployment that had upgraded its Groq or Gemini plan and pinned

    failure available to this module: the other side simply stops talking, and

    whole scene and the settlement corrects it at the end, which is negative
    whenever the estimate was generous, exactly as it is for every other kind.

    Roughly five grader calls, which is what a scene composes: the beats
    retrieval cannot fill, plus the one retry §6 allows on some of them. The
    static half of the prompt is identical on every turn of every scene, so on
    Anthropic it sits behind the `cache_control` breakpoint the tutor uses and
    the real figure comes in under this.
