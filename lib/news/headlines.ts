/**
 * The Estonian somebody is reading today, before anything believes a word of it.
 *
 * The dictionary's "Try" row used to be twelve rows off the top of an
 * alphabetical list, so every learner on every day was offered `aasialane`,
 * `aatomipomm` and `aberratsioon`. Nobody looks up an aberration. The row is
 * meant to say "here is what this dictionary is for", and it was saying "here
 * is where the table starts".
 *
 * A news feed is the cheapest honest source of words that are actually in the
 * air today, and this is the half of reading one that a machine can do without
 * touching the network: pull the headlines out of the XML, and pull the words
 * out of the headlines.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING. Every string that leaves here is a *candidate*, exactly
 * as `lib/scan/extract.ts` produces candidates from a photograph, and for the
 * same reason: this is text from outside the app, and outside text does not
 * get to add Estonian to anything. `lib/dict/suggest.ts` hands each one to
 * `matchEstonianForm`, which offers it only if the dictionary recognizes the
 * exact spelling, a stored form, or a regular case of the genitive stem. A
 * headline could be about a company nobody has heard of and the worst that can
 * happen is that no word from it is offered.
 *
 * Pure and framework-free, so the parsing can be tested over a fixture rather
 * than over whatever the news happens to be this morning.

 * A token in full capitals is an abbreviation. `ERR` and `EL` are not words
 * anybody looks up, and lower-casing them would hand the matcher something
