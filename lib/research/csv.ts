/**
 * The export as one flat file, which is the form somebody actually opens.
 *
 * The JSON is the complete answer and is what a second program should read.
 * This is for the person who was sent it: one row per published cell, one
 * column per thing about that cell, openable in a spreadsheet and loadable in
 * one line of R or pandas. Long rather than wide, so that a table with one
 * dimension and a table with three live in the same file without a second
 * header, which is what lets the whole export be one attachment.
 *
 * The method travels with the data. Every line above the header starts with a
 * `#`, which both `read.csv(comment.char = "#")` and `read_csv(comment = "#")`
 * skip without being asked twice, and a spreadsheet shows as text at the top.
 * A file of percentages with no denominators and no caveats is the thing this
 * whole feature is trying not to produce, and a method note that lives in a
 * different file from the numbers is a method note that gets separated from
 * them by the second email.
