/**
 * What a lot of people learning Estonian get wrong, counted, with nobody in it.
 *
 * Every graded review already lands in `Review` carrying what was asked and how
 * it went, because the scheduler needs exactly that. `lib/stats/history.ts`
 * already turns those rows into accuracy per grammatical case, and every
 * learner sees their own version of it on Progress. `lib/classroom/roster.ts`
 * already does the group version for a class, gated so that a small room cannot
 * be read back to one pupil. This is the same two pieces aimed at a whole
 * deployment rather than at one person or one classroom: which case, which
 * gradation pattern, which word, and how often it comes back right.
 *
 * That number does not exist anywhere else. A textbook's difficulty ordering is
 * somebody's judgment, a classroom's is twenty-five people, and a corpus of
 * written Estonian records what natives produce rather than where learners
 * fail. This records the second thing at a size no single course reaches, and
 * it costs nothing to collect because it was collected already: not one row is
 * written for it, and nothing new is asked of anybody.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE TO HAND SOMEBODY IS THIS FILE, so it is worth saying
 * plainly what the danger is. A table of averages looks anonymous and often is
 * not. A cell only one person contributed to is that person's answers with a
 * percentage sign on it, and a cell ten people contributed to where one of them
 * supplied nine tenths of the reviews is very nearly the same thing.
 * Statistical disclosure control is a small, well understood field about
 * exactly this, and four of its rules are implemented here rather than
 * described:
 *
 * 1. **A threshold rule.** A cell is published only if at least `MIN_LEARNERS`
 *    distinct people contributed to it and it rests on at least `MIN_REVIEWS`
 *    answers. Below either, the cell is withheld entirely: not reported as a
 *    size, not reported as zero. `/api/metrics` reports a small cohort's size
 *    with no rates, because there the totals would otherwise lie. Here nothing
 *    is published that depends on the totals, so nothing is said at all.
 *
 * 2. **A dominance rule.** No single learner may account for more than
 *    `MAX_LEARNER_SHARE` of a cell's answers. Ten people is not ten people when
 *    one of them is nine tenths of the data, and this is the check a plain
 *    head count misses. Official statistics have applied the same rule to
 *    business tables for decades.
 *
 * 3. **Complementary suppression.** A group of cells that hides exactly one of
 *    them, and publishes the rest, has not hidden it: it is recoverable by
 *    subtraction from any total the reader can reconstruct. So a group that
 *    hides one cell hides a second, the smallest of the ones that passed. No
 *    section publishes a total of its own either, which is the other half of
 *    the same argument.
 *
 * 4. **Deliberate imprecision.** Answer counts are rounded and learner counts
 *    are reported as a band rather than a number. Two vintages of this file
 *    otherwise let a reader difference them and recover what happened in
 *    between, which is the one attack the three rules above do not touch. It
 *    costs a researcher nothing: a proportion resting on 4,830 answers and one
 *    resting on 4,834 are the same finding.
 *
 * The thresholds are the same in every section, which is a decision rather than
 * laziness. It makes one sentence true of the whole file, and one sentence is
 * what an operator can actually check before sending it to anybody.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Pure, like `lib/stats/retention.ts` next door and for the same reason: the
 * database read lives in the route, this takes tallies and hands back a
 * publishable table, and the tests need no Postgres to say whether the gate
 * holds. Nothing here ever sees an owner id except to count how many distinct
 * ones there were, and the id itself cannot reach an output field.
 */

/**
 * The smallest number of distinct people behind a published cell.
 *
 * Ten rather than the five `/api/metrics` uses, and the difference is who reads
 * the answer. That endpoint is the operator looking at their own deployment
 * from behind a token. This file is meant to be sent to somebody outside it,
 * and a number that leaves the building should cost more to publish than one
 * that does not. Ten is also where most statistical offices settle for a table
