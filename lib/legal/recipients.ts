    THE ONE THAT WAS MISSING, AND IT WAS MISSING FOR A REASON WORTH KEEPING.

    Everything above is a service the application code calls, so the list was
    built by asking the code what it was configured to call. The machine the
    code runs on is not one of those, and so it was the one recipient this page
    never named while handling every request on it: the pages rendered, the
    answers posted, and a request log with an address in it.

    Only where somebody else owns the machine. Self-hosted, the operator named
    at the top of the page is the host, and listing them again as a recipient
    of their own data would be noise. `VERCEL` is set by the platform itself,
    which is what makes this a fact about where the code is running rather than
    a guess.

    Named by company rather than by region. `vercel.json` pins the functions
    beside the database, so a European deployment's requests are answered in
    Europe, and that is not the question Article 44 asks: the company is
    established in the United States and is subject to being asked there.
