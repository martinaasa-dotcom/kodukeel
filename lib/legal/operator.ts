/**
 * Who is legally answerable for a Kodukeel deployment, and where a reader
 * complains if they are not satisfied.
 *
 * This app is a piece of software somebody installs, not a service with one
 * address. `/privacy` has always said so: "if you are using someone else's
 * installation of it, they hold the database." That sentence is honest and it
 * is not sufficient. GDPR Article 13(1)(a) wants the controller's identity and
 * contact details given at the moment data is collected, and the Information
 * Society Services Act asks a provider for a name, an address and an
 * electronic contact that can be reached directly. A page that says "ask
 * whoever runs this" satisfies neither, because there is no way to find out
 * who that is.
 *
 * So the identity is configuration, exactly like the database URL, and the
 * policy pages render it. Nothing is invented when it is missing: an unset
 * deployment says out loud that it has not been filled in, which is a state
 * the person deploying can see and fix, rather than a plausible-looking blank
 * that reads as though the question was answered.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Next, no Prisma. It reads the environment and returns a
 * shape, so the policy pages, the invariants and a test can all agree on it.

 * The rule one paragraph up is that nothing is invented when the identity is
 * missing, and this does not bend it. What it fixes is a different failure:
 * the canonical deployment at kodukeel.ee had the mechanism, had the
 * documentation, had a test, and had nobody named on it, because setting four
 * variables in a dashboard is a step outside the repository and so a step that
 * does not happen. A controller notice that is correct in the abstract and
 * blank in production is the shape of compliance that fails an audit, and it
 * failed one here: the page said the operator had not been named for as long
 * as anybody had been able to read it.
 *
 * So the deployments this project runs identify themselves in the repository,
 * where a review sees them and a check can fail on them. This is **not** a
 * default and **not** a placeholder. It is keyed on the canonical origin, so
 * it answers only for the host it names: somebody forking this and serving it
 * from their own domain gets exactly the unset state they had before, which is
 * the honest answer for them, and could not accidentally publish a Tallinn
 * company as the controller of their school's data.
 *
 * Environment variables still win, so an operator who sets them is never
 * overruled by a table in someone else's source tree.

    `lib/auth/canonical.ts` exists precisely because a Vercel deployment serves
    its custom domain and its `*.vercel.app` address at once, and sign-in
    cannot survive the difference. The same is true one layer over: the
    platform's own `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` names whichever of the two
    the project has as its production domain, and a table holding only the
    custom one would answer nothing on a project that had not been given one
    yet. Naming a controller is not a thing to leave resting on a DNS setting.

    Not a wildcard, and that is what keeps it safe. `kodukeel.vercel.app` is a
    subdomain this project holds, exactly as it holds the custom domain;
    anybody else's deployment answers on their own name and gets the unset
    state. A rule matching `*.vercel.app` would hand this company's registered
