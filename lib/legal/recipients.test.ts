/**
 * Who a deployment tells its readers it sends things to.
 *
 * Article 13(1)(e) asks for the recipients of personal data, and this page is
 * generated from the deployment's own configuration precisely so the answer
 * cannot go stale. That only works if turning a feature on adds its recipient,
 * which is the thing these check — and it was not true of the error webhook,
 * which one variable switched on and no page mentioned.
 *
 * Every case sets the environment it wants and clears it afterwards. A test
 * that inherits the machine's own keys reports the machine rather than the
 * code, which this repository has already been bitten by once.
