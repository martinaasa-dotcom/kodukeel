/**
 * Reading a photograph of a page, and refusing to trust what comes back.
 *
 * A learner points a camera at a textbook page, a vocabulary list on the
 * whiteboard or last night's homework, and the model transcribes what is
 * printed there. That is optical character recognition, not authorship: the
 * Estonian on the page was written by somebody who knows Estonian, and the
 * model's only job is to copy it out.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SO SUSPICIOUS OF ITS OWN INPUT. A misread is
 * indistinguishable downstream from an invention, and ADR-005 exists because
 * `gpt-4o-mini` once produced "Ma söön aitamat" when asked for an example.
 * Nothing here can tell a badly-lit `ö` from a hallucinated word, so nothing
 * here pretends to: every string that comes out of this module is a
 * *candidate*, it is checked against the dictionary by
 * `lib/dict/resolveScan.ts`, and a candidate the dictionary does not vouch
 * for reaches a flashcard only after a person has looked at it beside the
 * paper and ticked it.
 *
 * Pure on purpose (the same rule as lib/estonian/): no network, no database,
 * no framework, so the parsing of a hostile reply can be tested over fixtures
 * rather than against whatever a provider felt like sending today.
