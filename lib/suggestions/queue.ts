/**
 * Reading the queue, in the shape a person can actually work through.
 *
 * THE VOLUME IS THE DESIGN PROBLEM. Every dead end in the app offers to send
 * one of these and sign-up is open, so the queue's size is decided by how many
 * people meet the same fault, not by how many faults there are. A list of rows
 * ordered by time would be one dead link repeated four hundred times, and the
 * one report that matters would be on page nine.
 *
 * So the unit here is a *group*: one line per thing being reported, carrying
 * how many people reported it and a few of their words. Acting on the line
 * acts on the group. Ordering is by report count within the group's own
 * category, because "forty-one people" is the strongest signal in the queue
 * and the only one that scales.
 *
 * The other half is the `before` side. An admin cannot judge "should be
 * kohvik" without knowing what the entry says now, and asking them to open the
 * dictionary in another tab for every row is how a review queue stops being
 * used. It is one batched read per page rather than one per row.

 * would be the expensive way round, and it had that backwards: Prisma applies
 * `distinct` in the client, so it emits no `DISTINCT` and, because a `LIMIT`
 * would cut rows before the deduplication, **no `LIMIT` either**. The SQL was
 * `SELECT id, groupKey FROM Suggestion WHERE status = $1 ORDER BY id`, which
 * is every matching row and an id column Prisma adds for its own use, sorted,
 * over the wire, deduplicated in JavaScript. The `groupBy` it was written to
 * avoid reads one row per group. The `take` that made it look bounded was not
 * in the query at all.
 *
 * Sign-up is open and every failure in the app offers the button that writes
 * one of these rows, so the volume the comment was worried about is real. It
 * is just that the fix pointed the wrong way.
