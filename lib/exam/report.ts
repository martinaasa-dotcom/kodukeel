/**
 * What to tell somebody who has just sat a paper.
 *
 * A score and a pass or fail is the least useful half of a mock examination.
 * The useful half is the list of things that went wrong and what each one is
 * called, which is exactly what a real result slip does not give you: the
 * Board reports four percentages and nothing else, and a candidate who failed
 * on 57 percent is left to guess which part to work on.
 *
 * So this reads the marked paper back and says where the marks went, in the
 * order they are worth acting on. Everything here comes off `ExamResult`, which
 * came off comparisons with the dictionary, so no part of this feedback is a
 * model's opinion.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock.

   * because the real specification does, and `acceptsSlips` says in as many
   * words why it still names the letter: "a learner who never sees them never
   * fixes them". They never saw them. And an order the writer did not choose
   * is marked right and carries the note saying where the writer put the word,

   *
   * So the test is the note rather than the shape: an answer that scored and
   * has a line against it belongs on the screen, and a third item type that
   * grows one lands here without anybody remembering to wire it up. It is not
   * a second copy of `missed`, and the screen draws it as what it is, which is
   * a right answer.
