/**
 * Where the app thinks a learner is, and how likely they are to pass each paper.
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT THE ARITHMETIC, IT IS SAYING HOW SURE WE ARE.
 *
 * A number like "68 percent likely to pass B1" is worth having and is very easy
 * to make up. Everything a percentage like that could rest on is already in the
 * review log, which is the whole argument for computing it rather than storing
 * one (ADR-014): how many words at the level have stuck, how often recall
 * actually succeeds, which cases are shaky, and which of the four skills the
 * learner has ever practiced at all.
 *
 * What the log cannot supply is confidence in its own answer. Somebody who has
 * done forty reviews has a coverage figure, and it means almost nothing. So the
 * estimate is made in two steps, and both are published:
 *
 *   1. A **predicted score** for each part, from coverage and accuracy.
 *   2. A **confidence** that the total clears sixty percent, which is a logistic
 *      on the margin whose spread widens as the evidence thins. Thin evidence
 *      does not make the app confident and wrong, it makes it visibly unsure.
 *
 * And a ceiling on top of that: a learner with a hundred reviews behind them
 * cannot be told they are 94 percent certain of anything, whatever the model
 * says, because the model has not seen enough of them to earn the claim.
 *
 * A paper they have actually sat outranks all of it. A measured result is
 * evidence of a kind no amount of flashcard history can substitute for, so the
 * most recent sitting at a level carries most of the weight for that level.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock beyond what the caller passes in.

    elsewhere and taken this paper to check can pass it knowing sixty of the
    five hundred words the course happens to teach. Their coverage is 0.12,

    entries at B1 against 99 at C1, so somebody who has met every C1 word the

    outright, since a paper failed is clamped below the pass mark and a paper
    passed above it, and a learner can fail B1 on a bad evening and pass B2 in

    bottom of the range "We'd bet on you passing A2" to somebody whose own
    record showed A1 sat and failed at 20 percent.

    A level is a claim about everything you can do at it, so a level the app

    exactly one half by construction. So a paper passed at 85 percent by

    and the hub printed "No level assessed yet" and a question mark over a level
    list whose own row said "You sat this and scored 85 percent, which is a
    pass". The clamp fixed the sentence and left the headline arguing with it,
    which is the fault it was written to end, one screen up.

    CLAUDE.md already states the rule this needs: a paper actually sat outranks
    the model for its own level. The model is a coverage share of *this app's*
    word list, which a learner who never used this app has no reason to have
    met, and it is not evidence against a paper they actually sat.
