/**
 * Marking a paper.
 *
 * TWO RULES SHAPE EVERY LINE OF THIS.
 *
 * **No model decides whether an answer is right.** Every mark below is settled
 * by comparing what the learner typed or chose against a form that came out of
 * the dictionary. That is the same ordering `app/api/write/route.ts` keeps, and
 * for the same reason: a hallucination that marks a correct answer wrong is the
 * failure that destroys trust fastest, and here it would do it while telling
 * somebody whether they are ready to sit a real examination.
 *
 * **A part is marked out of what was actually asked.** `buildPaper` reports a
 * shortfall when the dictionary could not fill a task; the weighting here uses
 * `rawAvailable` rather than the specification's raw total, so a thin paper
 * gives an honest percentage of a shorter paper instead of a punishing
 * percentage of a paper that was never set.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock.
