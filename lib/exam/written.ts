 * It lives here rather than being exported from the marker because the sitting
 * screen may not import the marker at all, which is the invariant that stops a
 * client marking its own paper, and one convenience import is exactly how a rule
 * like that gets softened.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock, no provider. The two modules it leans
 * on are pure for the same reason, which is what lets the marker and the
 * screen agree on which spellings count without either of them reaching a database.

  /*
    AND A PHRASE IS SEVERAL WORDS, WHICH THIS COULD NOT SEE.

    `tidy` strips everything that is not a letter, spaces included, so a
    required word whose lemma is a phrase arrives in `accepted` as one
    spaceless string: `Kas sa räägid inglise keelt?` is stored as
    `kassaräägidinglisekeelt`. The comparison above is against single
    whitespace-delimited tokens, and no token can ever equal that. So a
    candidate told to use a phrase, who then used it perfectly, was credited
    with nothing: the chip never ticked while they wrote, and the server
    marked it unused when they handed in.

    The course teaches twenty of these in its first unit, `Tere hommikust!`,
    `Aitäh!`, `Kuidas läheb?`, `Ma ei saa aru`, and they are `PHRASE` entries
    with no forms, so the whole of what counts as using one is the phrase
    itself. A mock exam that marks a right answer wrong is the fault this
    file's own header is about, pointed the other way.

    Joining consecutive tokens is all it takes, because `tidy` has already
    removed the spaces from both sides: the window `kas sa räägid inglise
    keelt` tidies and joins to exactly the string `accepted` holds. Bounded by
    the longest phrase the word actually carries, so an ordinary one-word
    entry does no extra work at all.
