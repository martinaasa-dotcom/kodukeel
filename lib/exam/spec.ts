/**
 * What the Estonian state language examination actually is.
 *
 * The app mocks a real exam, so the shape of that exam is data rather than
 * something a page improvises. Everything in `OFFICIAL` below was read off the
 * Education and Youth Board's own specifications and is cited in
 * `docs/16-exam.md`: four parts, the minutes each one runs for, the points each
 * one carries, and the rule that decides a pass.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ARE KEPT APART HERE ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The **frame** is the real exam: parts, durations, points, the 60 percent
 * pass mark, and the clause that a zero in any one part fails the whole paper
 * however good the other three were. A learner sitting this should meet the
 * same clock and the same arithmetic they will meet in the hall.
 *
 * The **tasks** are the app's stand-ins. The real paper sets a 400 word
 * magazine article and a live examiner; this one has a dictionary and a speech
 * synthesizer. So each task declares, in `standsFor`, which official task type
 * it is standing in for, and the exam screen prints that. An imitation that
 * does not say where it stops imitating is a lie about how ready somebody is,
 * which is the one thing a mock exam must never be.
 *
 * Nothing here writes Estonian. The task specs describe shapes; the sentences
 * that fill them come from Ekilex by way of `./paper` (ADR-005).
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock.
