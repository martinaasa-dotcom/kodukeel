/**
 * Assembling one paper.
 *
 * THE WHOLE MODULE EXISTS BECAUSE THE APP MAY NOT WRITE ESTONIAN (ADR-005).
 * A mock exam is the most tempting place in this codebase to break that rule:
 * a model would happily produce four reading passages and thirty questions in
 * a second, and roughly one form in every ten would be invented. So every
 * Estonian character in a finished paper came out of the dictionary, and this
 * module only ever hides, shuffles, or surrounds it. The same discipline
 * `lib/estonian/cloze.ts` already applies to a single exercise, applied to a
 * three hour paper.
 *
 * The consequence is that a paper is only as long as the dictionary can make
 * it, and the honest thing to do about that is say so. Every task reports a
 * `shortfall`: how many items it could not fill and why. The exam screen prints
 * it, and `../exam/score` marks the part out of what was actually asked rather
 * than out of what the specification wanted. A paper that quietly dropped six
 * questions would inflate every score built on it.
 *
 * DETERMINISTIC. A paper is a pure function of the level, the seed and the
 * pool, so a reload during a sitting rebuilds the same questions instead of
 * quietly handing the learner a fresh set halfway through the listening part.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no Prisma, no clock, no Math.random.
