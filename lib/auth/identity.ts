/*
  WHO IS SIGNED IN, ANSWERED WITHOUT ASKING THE AUTH SERVER EVERY TIME.

  `getUser()` is a network call. That is the whole point of it: it hands the
  access token to Supabase and asks whether it is still good, which is the
  safest possible answer and costs a round trip from the deployment to the auth
  service. This app was making three of them on every signed-in page load. The
  middleware made one for the gate, `requireUserId()` made a second, and
  `currentLearner()` made a third, each one waiting on the last, and none of
  them able to reuse another's answer because they were separate `cache()`
  entries around separate clients.

  With the project and the learner in different parts of the world that is
  most of the wait between pressing "Continue with Google" and reading a
  screen. It is also how a slow minute at the auth service became a 504: the
  middleware had no deadline on that call, so it waited until the platform
  gave up on it at twenty-five seconds and served a gateway error, which is
  the worst available way to say "the login server is busy".

  Two changes, and this module holds both.

  `getClaims()` replaces `getUser()`. A Supabase access token is a signed JWT,
  so with asymmetric signing keys the signature can be verified here, against
  a key set cached in the process, and no round trip happens at all. The
  fallback is the old behavior rather than a weaker one: on a project still
  using the legacy shared secret there is no public key to verify against, so
  `getClaims()` calls `getUser()` itself and the answer is exactly as
  authoritative as before. Migrating the project to signing keys is what turns
  the remaining round trip off, and it is a dashboard setting rather than a
  code change.

  What that trades is freshness. A session revoked elsewhere (signed out on
  another device, the account deleted) is caught by `getUser()` on the next
  request and by a locally verified token only once that token expires, which
  is the access token lifetime the project sets, an hour by default. The
  allowlist is not part of that trade: the address is a claim inside the
  token, so `isAllowedEmail` still runs on every gated request and revoking
  access still takes effect immediately.

  And every call gets a deadline. `boundedTransport` is the fetch the client
  is built with, so the deadline covers the token refresh and the fallback
  alike, and it records whether the service answered at all. That is what
  makes the third state below possible, and the third state is the one that
  matters: a timeout is not an answer, and reading it as "signed out" would
  sign a learner out of their own deck over a bad minute at somebody else's
  server.
