 * Who may read the suggestion queue and push a change through it.
 *
 * KODUKEEL IS SOFTWARE SOMEBODY INSTALLS, so "the admin" is not a role this
 * app can hand out: it is whoever runs the copy, exactly as the controller on
 * /privacy is. `lib/legal/operator.ts` answers that question from the
 * environment and refuses to invent an answer, and this is the same shape.
 *
 * Two deployments, two answers, and neither of them is a flag:
 *
 * - **Local**, with no Supabase keys, is one learner on their own machine
 *   (ADR-013). Their dictionary is their dictionary and there is nobody else
 *   to moderate, so they review their own queue. Anything else would put a
 *   feature behind an OAuth project they deliberately do not have.
 * - **Hosted**, with Supabase configured, reads `ADMIN_EMAILS`. With none set
 *   nobody is an admin and the queue says so out loud, because a page that
 *   quietly says nothing looks finished. It never falls back to "the first
 *   user" or "anybody signed in": an open sign-up plus a guessed rule is how
 *   a review queue becomes a way to edit the dictionary without review.
 *
 * There is no way to grant this from inside the app, and that is deliberate.
 * A privilege that can be granted by a request is a privilege that can be
 * granted by a forged one.
