/**
 * The one address this deployment lives at, and where a request on any other
 * address is sent.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: GOOGLE SIGN-IN WAS LANDING ON THE WRONG HOST.
 *
 * A Vercel deployment answers on two names at least, `<app>.vercel.app` and
 * whatever domain was pointed at it, and sign-in is the one path that cannot
 * survive the difference. `signInWithOAuth` asks Supabase to send the learner
 * back to `<origin>/auth/callback`, and Supabase honors that only where the
 * address is on the project's Redirect URLs list; anywhere else it falls back
 * to the project's Site URL, silently. So somebody signing in on the custom
 * domain came back on `kodukeel.vercel.app`, and the exchange there failed,
 * because the PKCE verifier is a cookie on the domain they started from. What
 * they saw was a generic "that sign-in did not go through" on a host they had
 * not typed, and pressing the button again from there worked, which is the
 * exact shape of a fault everybody describes as finicky and nobody reports.
 *
 * The dashboard half of that is the operator's, and the README says what to
 * add. This is the app's half: with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` set, a request on
 * any other host is answered with a permanent redirect to the same path on
 * the canonical one, before anything else looks at it. Then there is only ever
 * one origin for the verifier cookie, the session cookie and the callback to
 * agree on, and a stale bookmark on the platform's own name lands where the
 * app now lives.
 *
 * It is `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because it is genuinely public: it is the address on
 * the front of the site. Nothing here is a secret and CI's bundle scan skips
 * it for that reason.
 *
 * Three things are deliberately NOT redirected, and each is a deployment that
 * would otherwise bounce to production.
 *
 *   A Vercel preview. Every preview has a host of its own by design, and one
 *   that sent its visitors to production would be a preview nobody could
 *   look at. `VERCEL_ENV` says which kind of deployment this is.
 *
 *   A loopback address. `vercel env pull` hands a developer the production
 *   variables, this one included, and a dev server on localhost that bounced
 *   every request to the live site would be unusable.
 *
 *   A request with no host at all, which is not a browser, and has nothing to
 *   be sent anywhere.
 *
 *   A path the platform's scheduler calls (`SCHEDULED_PATHS`). Vercel's cron
 *   calls the production deployment on its own `*.vercel.app` name and does
 *   not follow a redirect, so a 308 there is the daily mail run answered with
 *   nothing and ended, every day, in silence. Those routes check their own
 *   bearer secret and read no cookie, so which host they arrive on is not a
 *   question sign-in cares about.
 *
 * Pure, so the rule is unit tested rather than driven through a deployment.
