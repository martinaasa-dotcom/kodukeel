 * everything else here stopped making: no 2,500ms deadline, no local
 * verification of the token's signature, and no sharing with the
 * `requireUserId` the same request had already resolved. So an admin page paid
 * two unbounded round trips for one question, and a bad minute at the auth
 * service hung the review queue rather than failing it.

 * means the session was gone or unverifiable between middleware and handler.
 * That is worth a loud failure rather than silently leaking another user's
 * data, and it is the reason the middleware is allowed to let an unresolved
 * request through at all: this is the check that actually decides.
 *
 * With no Supabase keys the app runs as a single local learner
 * (lib/auth/mode.ts) and every row belongs to LOCAL_USER_ID.
 *
 * Deduplicated per request, which is what makes it cheap enough for every
 * action and page to resolve the user itself. That is the point: an owner id
 * must never be a parameter a caller can supply. Everything in
 * `app/actions.ts` is a public endpoint (`"use server"`), so an `ownerId`
 * argument there would let any signed-in user name somebody else's id and
 * read or write their data.
