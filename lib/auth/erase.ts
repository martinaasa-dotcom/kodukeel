/**
 * Erasing the sign-in identity, which is the half of deletion the app used to
 * leave behind.
 *
 * `deleteMyAccount` empties every table this app owns, in one transaction, and
 * /privacy promised that as the whole of it. It was not: the identity itself
 * lives in Supabase Auth, not in our schema, so a learner who deleted
 * everything and signed out left their email address, their Google subject id
 * and their sign-in history sitting in the auth store with no route to remove
 * them and nothing on the page admitting it. Article 17 is a right to erasure
 * of personal data, and an email address is personal data wherever it is
 * stored.
 *
 * It needs the service-role key, which is the same key the shared audio cache
 * uses and is server-only for the same reason: it bypasses row-level security.
 * Where that key is not configured the identity genuinely cannot be removed
 * from here, so this returns "cannot" and the caller says so to the learner in
 * as many words. A deletion that quietly leaves something behind is worse than
 * one that reports what it could not reach, because only the second can be
 * followed up.
