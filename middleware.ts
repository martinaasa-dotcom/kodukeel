/**
 * Three jobs, in the order they have to happen.
 *
 * 1. **Refuse a forged mutation**, before anything else looks at the request.
 * 2. **Refresh the Supabase session cookie** (required by `@supabase/ssr`,
 *    since Server Components cannot write cookies themselves) and gate every
 *    route except the public ones: the landing page, sign-in, the OAuth
 *    callback and the offline fallback.
 * 3. **Set the Content Security Policy** on whatever response comes out.
 *
 * With no Supabase keys configured the app is a single-learner local install
 * (lib/auth/mode.ts) and there is no session to refresh or gate, so step two
 * steps aside entirely rather than redirecting to a sign-in page that could
 * never sign anyone in. Steps one and three still run: a local install is
 * still a browser, and it is still worth not being framed.
 *
 * THIS RUNS ON EVERY REQUEST, WHICH IS WHAT MADE STEP TWO EXPENSIVE. It asked
 * the Supabase auth service who was signed in over the network, every time,
 * with no deadline on the answer: on the landing page and the privacy notice
 * as readily as on somebody's deck, and for a visitor who had never signed in
 * at all. A slow minute at that service was therefore a slow minute for the
 * whole app, and once it stopped answering entirely the middleware sat there
 * until the platform gave up on it and served a 504, which is the least
 * useful sentence available for "the login server is busy".
 *
 * Three things in order, cheapest first, and each one is a question the next
 * one no longer has to ask.
 *
 * A public page that reads the same signed in or out needs no identity, so it
 * is answered without building a client. A request carrying no session cookie
 * is signed out, definitively, and that is the first visit every new learner
 * makes. Only what is left goes to `readIdentity`, which verifies the token
 * rather than asking about it, and does so under a deadline.

    A REQUEST ON THE WRONG HOST IS ANSWERED WITH WHERE THE APP LIVES, AND

    A deployment answers on the platform's own name as well as its domain,
    and sign-in cannot survive the difference: the PKCE verifier is a cookie
    on the origin the learner pressed the button on, and Supabase sends them
    back to its Site URL wherever the origin they asked for is not on its
    list, so one sign-in was starting on the domain and finishing on
    `kodukeel.vercel.app` with nothing to finish it with. With
    `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` set there is one origin, permanently, and a stale
    bookmark lands on it too. See lib/auth/canonical.ts for what is exempt.

    308 keeps the method and the body, and the gate is going to see the same
