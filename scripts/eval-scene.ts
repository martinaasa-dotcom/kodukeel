/**
 * The second half of Phase 0: is a composed line safe to show?
 *
 *   npm run eval:scene                  # both halves
 *   npm run eval:scene -- --lines 5     # more samples per beat
 *   npm run eval:scene -- --scene arsti-aeg
 *
 * `measure:scenes` answered the first half and the answer decided the shape of
 * the module: retrieval fills the moves every conversation shares and fills the
 * content beats at zero, because a lexicographer records a sentence to
 * illustrate a word rather than to ask a question about it. So the composer is
 * load-bearing rather than a fallback, and everything now rests on the gate.
 *
 * §6 of the design sets the number this has to produce and the line it has to
 * clear: "above one line in twenty withheld, either the word list is too small
 * or the model is the wrong one for this, and the answer is not to loosen the
 * gate." That is a decision somebody makes before Phase 1 is built, not a
 * dashboard watched afterwards.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM NEEDS A KEY.
 *
 * The gate rejection rate needs a real model saying real things, so it needs a
 * provider. The government check does not: §2 proposes it and marks it
 * "unmeasured", and the labeled set it wants can be built out of the shipped
 * dictionary alone, because Ekilex recorded both the government and the
 * sentences. So this runs its second half on any machine and says what it could
 * not do rather than refusing to start.
 *
 * IT TALKS TO OPENROUTER DIRECTLY, like `scripts/eval-anu.mjs` beside it, and
 * it does not go through `lib/usage/ledger.ts`. That is not the rule being
 * bent: the ledger rations one learner's share of a deployment's budget, and
 * nobody's allowance is involved when a developer runs a measurement against
 * their own key. It imports the model chain rather than naming one, for the
 * reason `PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` is imported and not retyped: a list that lives in
 * a script measures the script.
