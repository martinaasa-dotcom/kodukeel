/**
 * Builds the built-in dictionary from sources, rather than by hand.
 *
 * The seed was 370 words somebody typed, which is a fine demo and a poor
 * dictionary: offline review, the minimal-pair finder and the government drill
 * are all bounded by it, and a learner with no connection meets the ceiling on
 * their first session.
 *
 * WHO IS ALLOWED TO WRITE WHAT (ADR-005, and the whole point of this script):
 *
 *   Estonian forms      Ekilex, the Institute of the Estonian Language. CC BY.
 *   Estonian sentences  Ekilex usages, verbatim, as lexicographers recorded them.
 *   English glosses     Wiktionary. CC BY-SA 4.0, community written.
 *   This script         the joining, the filtering, and nothing else.
 *
 * No model writes a character of the output. That is not a style preference:
 * a wrong inflected form does not sit there being wrong, the scheduler drills
 * it until the learner believes it.
 *
 * Candidates come from Wiktionary's Estonian part-of-speech categories rather
 * than from a list written here, so the vocabulary is attested rather than
 * remembered. Proper nouns and multi-word entries are dropped: a flashcard for
 * "Aabraham" teaches nobody Estonian.
 *
 * Resumable. Every answer is cached to disk as it arrives, so an interrupted
 * run continues instead of asking two public APIs for the same thing twice.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/expand-seed.ts            # fetch and write the seed file
 *   npx tsx scripts/expand-seed.ts --limit 50 # a small run, for checking
