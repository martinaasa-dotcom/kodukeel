 * `lib/estonian/exceptions.ts` states, for each slot, the pattern a course
 * teaches, and reports every word whose stored form disagrees. A rule stated
 * that way is wrong until it has been measured: a first pass over the shipped
 * dictionary flagged four thousand partitive plurals, which is not a language
 * full of exceptions, it is a rule this file had written down badly.
 *
 * So this is the instrument the rules are corrected with, and it is the same
 * one `eval:scene` is: **read the ranked list, not the total**. A kind that
 * flags most of the dictionary is a kind whose rule is wrong or whose name is
 * wrong, and a kind that flags nothing is a rule with nothing behind it.
 *
 * No database and no network: it reads `prisma/data/expanded.json`, which is
 * what `npm run db:seed` loads, and `prisma/data/harvested.ts`, which is where
 * the course words keep the forms no rule reaches. Both are needed, and they
 * cover different halves: the expansion holds the five principal parts of six
 * thousand words, and the harvest holds the simple past's third person and the
 * polite imperative, which only exist for the course.
