/**
 * Getting a review card to show its answer, whichever shape it took.
 *
 * A card is asked in one of four ways — flip, multiple choice, typed, and the
 * intro a card gets the first time it is seen — decided per card and per
 * preference. So a suite that only knows about "Show answer" does not fail
 * when the default changes: it finds no button, takes whatever else the code
 * around it does, and quietly stops testing. `smoke-offline.mjs` learned that
 * the expensive way when the dictionary grew and a multiple choice card
 * started coming up first, and its own comment says so.
 *
 * `scripts/test-containment.mjs` then had the same bug with a worse symptom.
 * It waived ten checks with the reason "the deck had nothing due" while the
 * deck had forty cards due, because the one that came up was a choice card and
 * the only thing it knew how to press was the flip. A waiver that states a
 * false reason is worse than a failure: the output tells you to go and seed a
 * database that is already seeded.
 *
 * Hence one definition. It *reveals* and never grades, because those are two
 * different needs: the offline suite wants the whole round trip, and a suite
 * measuring the revealed layout must leave the deck exactly as it found it for
 * everything that runs after it.
