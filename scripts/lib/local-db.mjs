/**
 * Resolves the database URL a development script may use, and refuses anything
 * that is not local.
 *
 * The scripts that import this destroy data on purpose: `test-restore` deletes
 * every Review row to prove a backup brings them back, `test-ekilex` clears a
 * word before re-fetching it, `demo-data` wipes a learner's cards before laying
 * down two months of invented history. All of that is correct against a scratch
 * database and catastrophic against a real one — `Review` is append-only and is
 * the one table whose loss is unrecoverable (CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * The hazard is not hypothetical. Prisma reads `DATABASE_URL` from the process
 * environment *before* it reads `.env`, so a shell that already carries hosted
 * credentials — which is exactly how a deployment-linked terminal is set up —
 * silently redirects every one of these scripts at production while `.env` sits
 * there saying `localhost`. Nothing in the output would have told you.
 *
 * So the check is a hard stop rather than a warning, it names the host it
 * refused, and it hands back the URL it approved. Callers pass that URL to
 * `PrismaClient` explicitly, which closes the gap between the connection that
 * was checked and the connection that is opened.
