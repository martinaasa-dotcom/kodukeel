/**
 * Preferences a browser suite depends on, set before it depends on them.
 *
 * A stored preference is shared state between suites, and this app has one that
 * decides whether a control is drawn at all. `letterBar` is per learner and
 * defaults to on; first run asks the question and Settings changes the answer.
 * So a database where any earlier suite walked through first run and chose "I
 * have them already" draws no letter bar, and every later suite that types
 * Estonian through it waits thirty seconds for a button that is correctly
 * hidden, then reports a timeout that names the button and not the reason.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened: `e2e.mjs` failed on a machine where
 * `test-assess.mjs` had run first, on an app with nothing wrong with it. CI
 * escapes it only because it seeds a fresh database for every run, which means
 * the one place this can bite is a person's own machine, running the suites in
 * their own order, with the least context for reading the failure.
 *
 * `test-mobile.mjs` had already worked this out and solved it for itself, in a
 * comment saying "started from a known answer, not from whatever the last run
 * left". This is that helper, hoisted, because two of anything is how they
 * drift, and because the rule it embodies belongs to every suite rather than
 * one: a suite that needs a preference sets it, rather than hoping the last
 * suite left it alone. Cleaning up after yourself is the weaker version of the
 * same idea, since it only works while every suite remembers, and it cannot
 * help the first run on a machine somebody has been clicking around on.
 *
 * Driven through the app rather than written into the database, so these stay
 * plain `.mjs` with no Prisma import and no second definition of what the
 * setting means.
