/**
 * What a script needs to ask a model for a scene line and judge it, keyless
 * context included, shared between the measurement and the drafting.
 *
 * `scripts/eval-scene.ts` built all of this inline to measure the gate, and
 * `scripts/draft-lines.ts` needs exactly the same chain, the same prompt and
 * the same context to draft lines the gate will then judge. Two copies of the
 * prompt are two prompts the day one is edited, and a rejection rate measured
 * on one and a bank drafted with the other would be a rate for nothing. So it
 * lives here once.
 *
 * THIS TALKS TO A PROVIDER DIRECTLY, like `scripts/eval-anu.mjs`, and goes
 * nowhere near `lib/usage/ledger.ts`: the ledger rations one learner's share
 * of a deployment's budget, and nobody's allowance is involved when a
 * developer runs a script against their own key. It imports the model chain
 * rather than naming one, for the reason `PROVIDER_KEY_ENV` is imported and
 * not retyped.
 *
 * THE CONTEXT IS BUILT FROM THE SHIPPED DICTIONARY, not a database, so both
 * scripts and the bank's own test run on any checkout. Everything below is the
 * *context* the shipped checks need; the checks themselves are the ones in
 * `lib/scenes/gate.ts`, imported and never copied.
 *
 * Nothing here runs at import time: the chain reads the environment when
 * asked, so a test may import the context builders without a key in sight.
