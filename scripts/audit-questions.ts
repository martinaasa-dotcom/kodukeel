/**
 * DOES ANY QUESTION THIS APP ASKS PRINT ITS OWN ANSWER?
 *
 * It is the one question no unit test can ask, because every generator here is
 * correct on the word a fixture picks and wrong on a handful somewhere in five
 * thousand. Asked over the shipped dictionary rather than over a fixture, this
 * found four separate faults in one afternoon, and none of them were visible on
 * any single word:
 *
 *   2,468 gap-fills whose hint was the answer, wherever the gap wanted the
 *     dictionary form and the hint gave the lemma;
 *   115 case cards for a case Estonian spells like the nominative, so
 *     `kallis → milles? kus?` had `kallis` on the back;
 *   15 gaps that left the answer standing later in the same sentence;
 *   34 crossword clues that were the English gloss and the Estonian word at
 *     once, `film` clued as "film".
 *
 * And then the flash round, which was written after all of that and walked
 * into two more shapes of the same fault, neither visible on any one word:
 *
 *   13 asks whose answer was a word in the English gloss printed beside it,
 *     the illative of `salv` being `salve` and its gloss "salve", `pagan`
 *     glossed "pagan, heathen", `mink` "American mink";
 *   1 gap that left the other half of a lexicographer's pair standing two
 *     characters away, `Auto jäi porisse/____ kinni.`
 *
 * A card nobody can get wrong is worse than no card. The scheduler reads every
 * pass as a recall and stretches the interval, so the slot is spent for ever,
 * and the learner is told they knew something they were shown.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not judge whether a question is hard, or whether the
 * wrong answers are any good: `lib/questions/distractors.ts` is where that
 * lives and it was measured separately. This asks one mechanical thing, which
 * is why it can be trusted over 47,000 cards.
 *
 * Two shapes are deliberately not faults and are excluded by name rather than
 * by luck. A matching task shows the word list, because pairing sentences to
 * words needs both halves on screen. And a `heard` question hides its prompt
 * from the eye on purpose: the answer being written beside it is the exercise.
 * Both were reported by the first version of this and both were the harness.
 *
 * No database, no network: it reads `prisma/data/expanded.json`, which is what
 * `npm run db:seed` loads.

  AND HOW MANY EACH ONE ASKED, WHICH IS THE HALF A SINGLE FLOOR CANNOT SAY.

  The floor at the bottom bounds the whole run, so it catches the deck, which

  entirely: the crossword is 5,329 of some 46,000 and the scene game 1,972, and
  either could return nothing without moving the total below 40,000. A section
  that asks nothing looks exactly like a section that passed, which is the
  fault `scripts/lib/checks.mjs` gives a suite a floor to prevent.

  So each one declares what it reaches and is held to four fifths of it. Four
  fifths rather than the number itself, because these counts move with the
  dictionary: a reseed adds words, and a floor that has to be edited on every
  reseed is a floor somebody edits without reading.

  The figures are measured rather than estimated, and the first version of this
  proved why: `exam` was guessed at 6,000 from a sentence in a pull request
  about a different measurement and actually asks 2,500, so the check failed on
  the run that introduced it. A floor is a fact about what the code does, and

  word headed by a plural has no singular to ask for at all (see
