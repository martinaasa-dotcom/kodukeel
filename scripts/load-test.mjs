 * What the app costs once somebody has actually used it.
 *
 * Progress here is derived on every request rather than stored (ADR-014),
 * which is the right call for correctness and the obvious thing to get wrong
 * for performance: a counter column cannot drift, but a query over the whole
 * review log gets slower every day somebody studies. Nothing had ever measured
 * that. The demo deck is 417 reviews, which is two weeks of one person, and at
 * that size Postgres will beat any index by simply reading the table.
 *
 * Two halves, because they fail differently:
 *
 *   QUERIES  the derived-progress functions, called directly against a heavy
 *            learner. This is where an O(reviews) mistake shows up, and it
 *            shows up as a number that grows when the deck does.
 *   ROUTES   real HTTP against the built app, concurrently. This is where a
 *            per-request cost that only appears under load shows up.
 *
 * Budgets are asserted, not printed. A benchmark nobody fails is a benchmark
 * nobody reads, and this one is meant to run in CI.
 *
