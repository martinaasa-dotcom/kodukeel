//     The row of õ ä ö ü š ž used to be drawn under every Estonian field on

//     bought a phone nothing and spent the one thing a phone has none of.
//
//     Measured rather than asserted in CSS, because "a desktop" is a width and
//     a pointer together and only a browser can answer both. `open()` above
//     sets `hasTouch` below 768, which is what makes the pointer half real
//     here rather than assumed.
//
//     COUNTED BEFORE IT IS JUDGED. `drawn === 0` is satisfied just as well by
//     a selector that matches nothing, which is how a check like this passes
//     for a year after the class is renamed. So each of these asserts the row
//     is in the page first.
//     STARTED FROM A KNOWN ANSWER, NOT FROM WHATEVER THE LAST RUN LEFT.
//     The round trip below turns the row off and back on, so a run that dies
//     between the two leaves the setting off in the database, and every width
//     check here then fails on the next run for a reason that has nothing to
//     do with the code. Setting it on first costs one page load and makes this
//     block say the same thing twice in a row.
//
//     `ensureLetterBar` lives in scripts/lib/prefs.mjs now rather than here.
//     The rule it embodies turned out to belong to every suite and not to this
