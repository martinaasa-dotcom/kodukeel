/**
 * Checks the built dictionary's English glosses against Wiktionary again.
 *
 * The glosses are the answer side of a flashcard, and a wrong one is not
 * inert: the scheduler repeats it until the learner has learned it. They come
 * from Wiktionary through `extractEstonianSenses`, so a fault in that parser
 * is silent by construction, because the output is a plausible English phrase
 * either way. A sample will not find it. This re-runs the parser over every
 * entry's own page and reports the ones that disagree.
 *
 * The first run, over the 2,164 entries at A1 to B1, found 25. Four of them
 * were a different word, not a different sense: `lamp` was drilled as
 * "random", `oktoober` as "hard hat", `ooper` as "opera house", `rida` as
 * "many, much". `{{l|en|lamp}}` renders as the word "lamp" and was being
 * deleted with the rest of the markup, which emptied the line and moved the
 * picker on to the next sense, and on a page with more than one etymology the
 * next sense belongs to another word entirely.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-glosses.ts              # report, change nothing
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-glosses.ts --write      # apply the corrections
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-glosses.ts --cefr A1,A2,B1
 *
 * Resumable: every page is cached under `prisma/data/.cache/`, so a second run
 * costs nothing and an interrupted one continues.

    A WHOLE PASS DOES NOT FIT IN ONE RUN, AND STOPPING DEAD WAS THE WRONG ANSWER.

    Wiktionary starts refusing part way through five thousand pages however
    politely they are asked: measured here at about 3,800 before a batch would
    not come back however long it was given. `fetchPages` threw, `main` never
    reached the comparison, and a run that had successfully fetched four fifths
    of the dictionary reported nothing at all about any of it.

    That is the wrong shape twice over. It threw away work that was done, and on
    a schedule it would have made the weekly job red for a fact about Wiktionary
    rather than a fact about a gloss, which is how a check becomes one everybody
    waives.

    So a refusal ends the fetching rather than the run, and what could not be
    read is *counted and printed* instead of being quietly skipped. That is the
    same third outcome `absent(n, why)` gives a browser suite, and it matters
    for the same reason: silence is how the first seed run recorded four fifths
    of the dictionary as having no English at all. Every page fetched is written
    to the cache as it arrives, so the next run picks up where this one stopped.
