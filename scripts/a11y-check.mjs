 * three quarters reported as passing while its description sat at 3.27.

 *
 * `test-design.mjs` learned this once already: its contrast pass measured a

 * 2.52:1 unseen by the suite whose job was finding it. That pass was replaced
 * by axe, which is better at everything except this, and the same hole came
 * back through the front door. axe files a one-character run as `incomplete`
 * with `messageKey: "shortTextContent"` — it has *measured* the ratio and
 * declines only to rule on whether a single glyph counts as text content —
 * and a report that reads `violations` alone throws that measurement away.
 *
 * The four grade buttons under every review card are what it was throwing
 * away: their keyboard hints are one digit each, `opacity-60` over an ink the
 * palette had already walked down to just clear the bar, and they measured
 * 2.45 to 2.61 against 4.5 on the busiest screen in the app. The interval
 * above them, being two characters, was reported and failed; the fainter thing
 * beside it was not.
 *
 * So a short run whose measured ratio is under the ratio axe itself expected
 * is a violation here. Two things are still let through, and neither is a
 * length. A node axe could not put a number on stays incomplete, which covers
 * `elmPartiallyObscured` and anything else arriving with `contrastRatio: 0`
 * and no colors: that is a genuine "cannot tell" rather than an answer being
 * withheld. And `data-ornament` is honored exactly as `test-design.mjs`
 * honors it, because the two suites have to agree about what counts as text:
 * a 92px step numeral in a hue's own tint, behind a card that says the same
 * thing in words, is decoration and the markup says so out loud. `aria-hidden`
 * is not that exemption and never stands in for it, since the tick on the week
 * strip carries `aria-hidden` and is still the thing a sighted reader looks at.

  fault the header names, and the first run over them found a real one: the

  eighty-six for these, and the floor keeps the same five under it.

  rounds from one and the conversations from the other. Each side measured 420
  with its own two, which is exactly the arithmetic this file warns about two
  paragraphs up, so the merged number is measured on the merged tree rather than
  added from either side. A scene is a whole session rendered from one component

  The same five of slack under it.

  the same reason: the per-route loop makes eight checks with no branch in it
  and the dark sweep makes a ninth, so two routes is eighteen exactly. The

  This ran at 1280 and nowhere else for the whole of its life, and
  `/accessibility` said so out loud in its own list of what does not conform:
  the phone layout was measured for targets, overflow and containment and never
  by axe. That is a gap in the sweep rather than a gap in the app, and the two
  read identically from the outside until somebody looks.

  What a phone actually renders here is not the desktop screen reflowed. The
  rail is `hidden md:flex` and the bar is `md:hidden`, so at 1280 the phone bar
  is `display: none` and axe skips it entirely, and at 390 the rail is. So the
  bar, its five cells, and the sheet behind its More button are markup this
  suite had never once looked at: a nav, a dialog, four sections of links and a
  close button, on every signed-in screen in the app. Several other rules swap
  markup at the same breakpoint rather than only stacking it.

  390 is the width, which is the middle of the three `test-mobile.mjs` measures
  and the one it uses for every state it has to drive rather than only measure.
  Two suites disagreeing about what a phone is would be two answers to one
  question; the other two widths are a question about layout, which is that
  suite's, rather than about markup, which is this one's.

  Both themes, for the reason the desktop dark pass gives: light and dark are
  two palettes, and at this width the words in the bar sit on a surface that
  does not exist at 1280.

  What it found on the run that introduced it: nothing. Every route is clean at
  390 in both themes, and so is the More sheet. That is worth writing down
  rather than leaving as an absence, because it is the difference between a
  sweep that has looked and one that has not, and it is what lets the statement

/*
  THE STATE A ROUTE DOES NOT ARRIVE IN, AND WHY ONE IS ENOUGH TO MATTER.

  Everything above sweeps a page as it loads, and WCAG exempts a control that
  is inactive: axe skips a disabled button's text on purpose, because nobody
  is being asked to read it. That exemption was doing work nobody had asked it
  to do here. Review's Undo button is `disabled` until a card has been graded,
  which is exactly how every visit to `/review` begins, so its key hint was
  outside this sweep for the whole of the app's life. Grade one card and the
  same node measures 2.57:1 on the light theme and 3.06:1 on the dark, against
  a bar of 4.5.

  So the rule is that a control which is only ever live after somebody has
  done something has to be swept after they have done it. One state rather
  than a matrix: the point is not to enumerate the app, it is that a suite
  which only ever sees arrival states cannot see this class of fault at all,
  and the review screen is where the class lives.

  It grades, which `lib/review.mjs` deliberately does not do for the suites
  that only reveal, so this costs the shared deck one card. That is the whole
  price of the state and it is stated here rather than discovered by whoever
  runs the next suite.
