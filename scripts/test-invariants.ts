  AN ATTESTED FORM ALWAYS BEATS A DERIVED ONE, AND THE TYPE IS WHAT ENFORCES IT.

  The app taught `toasse` as the illative of `tuba`. The dictionary held
  `tuppa` the whole time, under `ILL_SG_SHORT`, for 2,969 of the shipped
  entries. The illative is the one case of the eleven with a lexically
  unpredictable short form (the aditiiv), and `NounStems` had no field for it,
  so no screen could have shown it: `deriveCase(genSg, key)` took a bare
  genitive, and eight callers asked it for a form. Two of those decided whether
  a learner was right. A card asked for the illative of `aeg`, expected
  `ajasse`, and marked `aega` wrong; the scheduler then brought that card back
  until the learner stopped typing the correct answer.

  Prose would not have stopped it and did not: ADR-005 already said an attested
  form wins, and the code disagreed for a year. What stops it is that
  `illSgShort` is a REQUIRED field on `NounStems`, so a caller holding only a
  genitive stem does not compile. These two checks are the parts of that a
  regex can see: the field stays required, and nobody rebuilds the old
  shortcut beside it.

/*
  WHAT THE DICTIONARY STORES IS DECIDED BY THE RULES, NOT BESIDE THEM.

  ADR-005 amendment 1 lets a deterministic rule build a form off a stored one,
  and the rules are real: ten case endings on a genitive stem, six persons on a
  stored first person. What they are not is complete. A seeded deployment could
  not say `on`, could not say `oli` for any verb in the language, and had no
  short pronoun forms at all, which is what an Estonian sentence is made of.

  So the two builders store what the rules miss, and they ask the rules rather
  than carrying a list: `unreachableSlots` for a verb and `unreachableCaseForms`
  for a nominal. A list would be two copies of one fact, and the copy in the
  builder is the one that goes stale in silence, because nothing about a
  missing form looks like an error. It looks like a word that inflects less.

  Anchored on the calls, because a builder can import a function and go on using
  a table of its own, which is exactly what the weakest-case query did one
  directory over.

  2,016 shipped entries carried a doubled partitive plural and 120 a doubled
  genitive plural, and which of the pair the app used was decided by whoever
  read the rows, `stemsFrom` taking the first the database returned and every

  that and said so in a comment; the minimal-pairs round kept its own copy of
  the same three lines and did not, wrapping the fetch and the play in one
  `try` and setting a state that replaces the whole drill with "No audio, no
  drill. It runs on TartuNLP and needs a connection." That round autoplays on
  mount, which is the no-gesture case by construction, so on every phone and
  every Safari a learner opening it was told their connection was the problem
  and never shown the 80px play button behind that screen.

  `playClip` is the one answer. `components/Recorder.tsx` is exempt by name: it

  EVERY RATE IS THE ONE CLIP, STRETCHED IN ONE PLACE, AND NEVER BY THE BROWSER.

  is stretched by lib/audio/stretch.ts, which spends the slowing on the vowels
  and the pauses and keeps the consonants whole, from lib/audio/clip.ts alone.
  A `playbackRate` anywhere would be the browser's stretch back beside ours, a

    "Is it already there" is check-then-act, and this app has two paths that ask
    it. `addCardsFor` read the learner's existing cards for a word, filtered the

    gap both see an empty deck and both insert. Measured against a real database
    rather than reasoned about: two concurrent adds gave two cards, four gave
    four, and eight gave fourteen where two is right.

    `addUnitsToDeck` then arrived as the batched rewrite of the loop that called
    it, kept the shape and did not inherit the lock, which moved the fault from
    one word to a whole unit: eight concurrent adds of an eighteen-word unit
    wrote 180 cards where 36 is right. A learner meets either one by double
    tapping "Add to deck", or the last button of first run, and neither has a
    throttle in front of it because neither should.

    The lock is `lib/usage/ledger.ts`'s, for the reasons its header gives: the
    *transaction* form, so a connection pooler cannot strand it, and the
    blocking one, since the non-blocking form serializes nothing.

    satisfied by a version that still races: a transaction with no lock, a lock
    taken outside the transaction, or a lock with the read left outside it. And
    asserted as *one* lock, because two paths guarding themselves with two
    different keys are two paths neither of which guards the other.

    builder the frequency page also uses: the rule held perfectly and the check

  not how well but whether you turned up, and it kept the shields that protect
  it: `resolveStreakFor` banks those now, off its own high-water mark, because
  a badge used to and a shield that can no longer be earned is exactly the dead

  somebody painted, drawn on top of something else, or resized away from the
  size it declared. Then it swaps every run of text for a run of letters OF
  THE SAME LENGTH with no space and no hyphen in it and asks all four again,
  which is the question Estonian actually poses: a row fits today because the
  gloss it happens to hold has commas in it, and the compound of the same
  width has to fit as well.

  768 is where it earns its keep. It is neither end, so it went unmeasured
  longest, and it is the width at which the rail appears and the content

    would be worse.

    Three things follow and all three are here. The module decides with the

    REPORTED BY SOMEBODY USING THE APP, AND RIGHT ABOUT THE MECHANISM.

    A word looked up out of curiosity goes into one deck with everything else,
    and the review queue introduces unseen cards oldest first: sixty read,
    ordered by band, ten shown. So the word somebody stopped and looked up on
    the bus sits behind the whole course backlog, which on a deck built by
    adding a level in first run is a year long. Anki has the opposite failure,
    where everything a learner adds lands at the front, and the two fixes point
    in opposite directions, so it is worth writing down which one this is.

    THREE THINGS HOLD THE ANSWER UP AND EACH IS ANCHORED ON WHAT ROTS.

    `Card.source` has to be able to tell the two apart. It could not: both
    `addUnitsToDeck` and the button on a dictionary entry wrote `DICTIONARY`,
    so the column answered "which table did this come out of" rather than
    "whose idea was this word". `lib/srs/sources.ts` is the closed list and the
    reading, and no other file may name one of those values, because a literal
    written beside a `createMany` is a card filed under a label the round
    cannot see.

    `DICTIONARY` is claimed by neither side and has to stay that way. Reading
    it as a lookup fills the round with course words for every learner who
    already has a deck; reading it as course material hides the lookups they
    already have. Silence is never evidence and the safe direction is to claim
    less.

    And the trickle is ordered by the corpus this repository already counts.
    `commonFirst` is a partition rather than a rank, for the reason its own
    header gives at length: a nominal is counted on its dictionary form and a
    verb on its persons, so ranking one against the other compares two
    measurements. A comparator reading the index is the shape to catch.

/**
 * A query that is cut short is ordered all the way down to the primary key.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md has said for a while that "a query that is cut short says where to
 * cut", and nothing asserted it, so eleven queries in the derived-progress
 * layer had drifted from it or had never been brought in line. Every one of
 * them ordered on a column that is not unique and then took the first N.
 *
 * Two of those ties are not theoretical. `Card` was ordered by
 * `(createdAt, lexemeId)`, and `addCardsFor` writes a word's recognition and
 * production cards in one `createMany`, so both share both keys exactly. And
 * `Lexeme` was ordered by `(fetchedAt, lemma)` while `@@unique` is on
 * `(lemma, pos)`: on a freshly seeded deployment every `fetchedAt` is null, so
 * the two entries for `hall` tied outright.
 *
 * The exam pool is the one where that is a correctness fault rather than an
 * inconsistency. `submitExam` rebuilds the paper from (level, seed, pool) in
 * order to mark it, so a pool that comes back in another order marks a learner
 * on questions they were never asked, and the `take` means a tie at the five
 * hundredth row decides which of a pair is in the paper at all.
 *
 * Ordering is free where the index is already there, and it was in all eleven.
 * What is not free is a number that moves on its own.
 *
 * Scoped to `lib/progress/`, which is where every derived figure is read, and
 * asserted on the *last* key, because an order that is total in the middle and
 * loose at the end is loose.

  AND EVERYWHERE ELSE, A TRUNCATED QUERY AT LEAST SAYS WHERE TO CUT.

  The check below holds `lib/progress/` to a total order, because a figure drawn
  from those rows has to be the same figure twice. The rest of the app was held
  to nothing, and five reads had drifted to a `take` with no `orderBy` at all,
  which is not a weaker version of the rule: it is the plan choosing which rows
  the screen is built from. Today's weakest cases took an arbitrary five
  thousand; the government drill and the minimal-pairs round each took an
  arbitrary two thousand cards to decide which words were already in the deck,
  so whether an answer graded a real card changed between visits; the class week
  counted three figures off an arbitrary three hundred; and the dictionary's
  suggestion row shuffled an arbitrary two hundred.

  This asks only for an order, not for a unique one. Ending every truncated read
  in the app on the primary key is a larger change than this rule needs to be
  useful, and where a screen orders by `due` and cuts, arbitrary-but-stated
  still beats arbitrary-and-silent. The stricter rule stays where a number is

  A CONTROL LOOKS LIKE A CONTROL, AND A CHOSEN ONE LOOKS CHOSEN.

  Three faults, one cause: there was no primitive for "pick one of these", so
  every screen that asked invented its own answer and two of the three were
  wrong.

  The worst was a bare `<button>` wrapped round a `<Chip>`. A chip is the
  app's *label*: it is what the dictionary uses to say "B1" and "verb", and it
  carries no border, no shadow and no hover. Eight of them in a row under a
  heading read as a legend, so first run, the screen that decides a learner's
  year, did not read as a form at all. Selection swapped `--raised` for
  `--accent-soft`, which on the dark theme is two percent of lightness: the
  answer to the question was being carried by a difference somebody could look
  straight at and not see. And every option carried `aria-pressed`, so eight
  mutually exclusive answers announced as eight unrelated switches and cost
  eight tab stops.

  `components/Choice.tsx` is the one answer now, and its states live in
  `.choice` in app/globals.css rather than in a `style` prop, because an inline
  style beats a stylesheet and a control that paints its resting look inline
  can never define a hover. That is not a detail: it is the mechanism that made
  the missing hover unfixable in place.

  Asserted as a shape rather than as today's markup: a chip inside a button is
  the fault, wherever it appears.

    It had already drifted. Six places said `AI · verify` and three said a bare

/**
 * A fade never goes on words.
 *
 * `opacity` multiplies through everything inside a box, so a fade meaning
 * "secondary" is applied to the sentence as well as to the idea of it, and
 * there is no way to reason about the result from the palette. CLAUDE.md and
 * `docs/14-design-system.md` both say this; until now neither had anything
 * behind it.
 *
 * The four grading buttons are what made the case for asserting it rather than
 * writing it down again. Their ink is already the hue's own ink, which clears
 * 4.5:1 on its tint by construction, so nothing in the palette was wrong: the
 * fades on top of it were. Measured in a browser, the interval under each
 * button read 3.49 to 3.75 in the light theme and the keyboard hint 2.45 to
 * 2.62, on the screen a learner opens every day. axe reported four of those
 * twelve runs, and `test-design.mjs` none, because it walks `/review` as the
 * page arrives and the grading row is not drawn until a card is revealed.
 *
 * A fade is still how you quieten something that carries no words, which is
 * what `aria-hidden` marks: the padlock on a locked course unit is faded and
 * the sentence beside it is not. `disabled:` and `hover:` variants are a
 * control's own states rather than a way of ranking content, and 0 and 100 are
 * an animation's endpoints.
 *
 * This reads the utility form. An inline `style={{ opacity }}` is not covered
 * and cannot be: whether a box holds words is not a question the source can
 * answer once the value is computed.

    A corpus proposes and the dictionary decides, which is ADR-021's rule about
    a photographed page and ADR-024's about a headline, arriving through a
    third door. Four things hold it up and each was a way of getting this
    wrong.

    THE TABLE HOLDS NO ENGLISH. A generated file carrying a gloss beside each
    lemma is a second copy of the dictionary that goes stale the first time
    somebody corrects one, and the correction path in this app is a queue
    strangers write to. So the table is lemmas and the page joins.

    THE COUNTING NEVER FOLDS A DIACRITIC. `matchEstonianForm` accepts a lemma
    with its diacritics folded away, which is right for somebody typing `room`
    meaning `rõõm` and wrong over a corpus that is spelled correctly: it put
    `õli` at the top of the nouns on the 294,452 occurrences of `oli`, which
    is the past of `olema`.

    A WORD CARRIES A BAND. The same filter the suggestion row takes, and here
    it is what keeps an entry that happens to be spelled like a very common
    form of something else off the front of the list.

    AND THE ACTION TAKES A GROUP, NOT A LIST OF WORDS. Every export of
    `app/actions.ts` is a public endpoint whose arguments are JSON off the wire
    whatever the types say, so one taking lemmas would let a caller choose what
    gets built into a deck. A group name indexes a table in the repository and

    THE FOUR LISTS ARE NOW TWO SCREENS AND A ROUND, AND EACH IS A WAY OF

    ONE TABLE OF WHAT A LIST IS CALLED. `TITLE` and `BLURB` were two maps
    inside `CommonWords.tsx`, which was right while one screen printed them.
    Four do now: the dictionary's lists, the card on `/practice`, the round
    index and the round itself. A second copy is how "Describing words"
    becomes "Adjectives" on one screen out of four, which is the fault
    `lib/ux/modes.ts` and `lib/ux/nav.ts` each exist to prevent and which this
    app has fixed four times. Anchored on the label appearing exactly once in
    the tree, because a screen that imports the table and then writes its own
    heading beside it satisfies any check that only looks for the import.

    ONE ANSWER TO WHICH CARD OF A WORD TO ASK. `leastPractisedSlot` is the
    variety half of mastery: the slot the learner has been asked in least. Two
    routes render the Flash cards session now, the whole deck and one
    frequency list, and a second copy of that rule is two answers to "what
    should this word be asked as" that drift apart a tie break at a time.

    THE DEEPENING NAMES NO CARD TYPE. `deepenCommonWords` plans `CARD_TYPES`
    entire and lets `generateCards` decide what each word can build, so it
    cannot ask for a card its own words cannot make, which is the `objekt`
    fault. A hand-typed list here would be a fifth place the seven are written
    down, and would go stale the day an eighth arrives.

    AND IT IS BOUNDED. A hundred nouns built out into every case is well over
    a thousand cards for one press, which is the backlog first run already
    learned not to assemble by accident. `nextCommonBatch` is the bound.

    AND NO RENDER WRITES CARDS. This is the one that would be invisible.
    `PrefetchLink` fetches a whole page once a pointer has settled on a link
    for 90ms, so a round that topped the deck up while rendering would build
    somebody twenty words for hovering over the button, and the browser suites
    would never see it because they click. The add is a Server Action behind a
    press, and these two pages may not reach a deck write at all.

  WHICH FORMS CAN BE HIDDEN IN A SENTENCE IS ONE ANSWER.

  `buildCloze` hides a word it is told to look for, so what it can hide is
  whatever list the caller hands it, and there were five such lists. Two added
  the ten regular cases and were the same twenty lines twice; three did not,
  and the printable worksheet's own comment said "a sentence about `tuba`
  usually contains `toas`, not `tuba`, and hiding the inflected form is the
  more useful exercise" over a list that could not hide `toas`. None of the
  five knew a verb person, so `Kontsert algab kell 18.` could not be gapped for
  `algama`. Measured over the graded half of the dictionary, 2,201 words could
  carry a gap and 2,758 can now.

  `lib/exam/paper.ts` and `lib/assessment/items.ts` are the two exceptions and
  are exempt by name. Both build a marked instrument out of a pool and a seed,
  the exam rebuilds its paper server-side to mark it, and both surround the
  answer with distractors drawn from the same list, so widening what can be
  gapped changes which questions a candidate is asked and what is offered
  against them. That is a change to a measurement rather than to an exercise
  and it is not made in passing.

  syllabus/`, and the practice bullet said seven modes against 18 in
  `lib/ux/modes.ts`, which is the whole of the games this app grew and did not
  mention: the crossword, the picture board, the word a day, flash cards and
  Target. The flashcard line said five card types against seven, having missed
  gradation and government, which are the two nothing else drills. The course
  page's own header had a fourth answer, eighty-three, and counted six CEFR
  levels after C2 was cut.

  This is the first page anybody reads about the project and the one a funder
  or a teacher reads before installing anything, so an undercount is not a
  typo: it is the app selling itself short on the two things it is largest at.

  A PAGE ADDRESSED BY A ROW ID PROVES THE ROW IS THE LEARNER'S.

  Three routes name a row somebody owns: `/exam/result/[id]` is a sat paper

  right shape and was true of every one of them when this was written. The
  check is here so it stays true of the fourth.

  What it reads is narrow on purpose: a `where` in a `[param]` page that names
  the route's own parameter is a row being addressed by something a stranger
  can type, and it has to name `ownerId` too. A page whose parameter is a key
  rather than a row, which is the level, the case, the grammar topic and the

  THE PRIMARY BUTTON IS THE LAST ONE IN ITS ROW.

  three buttons side by side, the one painted in the accent sits on the right,
  where a thumb and a reading eye both end up, and the quieter choices sit to
  its left, weakest first. The learn ladder's first meeting led with "Got it"

  other way round, and thirty-odd finish screens each decided for themselves.
  A column is not a row: a `flex-col` stack or a `w-full` button reads top to
  bottom, and there the primary leads.
