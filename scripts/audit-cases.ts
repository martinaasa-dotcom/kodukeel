/**
 * Checks the case forms this app derives against the ones Ekilex records.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-cases.ts             # every nominal in the built dictionary
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-cases.ts --limit 50  # a sample
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-cases.ts --write     # and fill in the missing NOM_PL
 *
 * THE VERBS HAD THIS AND THE NOUNS DID NOT.
 *
 * `lib/estonian/derive.ts` builds the ten regular cases off the genitive stem
 * for every noun and adjective in the dictionary, which is the single most
 * load-bearing rule in the app: it is the back of a flashcard, the answer a
 * marker compares against, and the table on every grammar page. It was checked
 * against Ekilex for five words, the ones the landing page demonstrates, and
 * the note about that says so plainly. `scripts/audit-verbs.ts` does the same
 * job for the verb and covers 797 of them.
 *
 * So this is that script pointed at the other half of the language. For every
 * nominal the dictionary ships with an Ekilex word id, it fetches the forms the
 * Institute records, derives the same cases, and prints every disagreement by
 * lemma and case.
 *
 * BOTH COLUMNS, because both are printed. The singular obliques are a suffix on
 * the genitive singular; the plural obliques are the same suffix on the genitive
 * *plural*, and the nominative plural is the genitive singular plus `d`. All
 * three rules reach a learner through `buildCaseTable`, which is what the
 * dictionary entry, the grammar reference and the printable worksheet draw, so
 * a plural rule that is wrong is wrong on the same screens.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS AGREEMENT. `caseAnswer` returns every spelling a marker lets
 * through, not one, because Estonian genuinely has two illatives and a word can
 * carry a stored form beside a derived one. A slot agrees when Ekilex's own
 * value is among them. The illative is where that matters: `tuppa` is the
 * aditiiv and `toasse` the long form, Ekilex records both under different
 * codes, and either is right.
 *
 * `--write` fills in the nominative plural, which is the one slot this audit
 * both checks and can repair. It is the same latitude `audit:glosses --write`
 * takes over a translation: the answer is read off the source the generator
 * reads, and nothing here writes a character of Estonian of its own. It is
 * needed because `prisma/data/.cache/` is not checked in, so re-running the
 * whole expansion would mean asking Wiktionary for six thousand pages to carry
 * one form that Ekilex has already answered. `scripts/expand-seed.ts` produces
 * the same field on a fresh run, through `PRINCIPAL_PARTS` in
 * `lib/ekilex/mapper.ts`, so this is a shortcut to the generator's own output
 * rather than a second source for it.
 *
 * Needs EKILEX_API_KEY and the network. Responses are cached under
 * .ekilex-cache/ in the same files the harvest and the verb audit use, so
 * re-running costs Ekilex nothing.
