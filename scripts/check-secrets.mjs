 * Fails the build if a credential reached the client bundle.

 * CLAUDE.md makes this a non-negotiable, and a rule with no enforcement is a
 * comment. Everything the browser downloads is scanned: the pattern list is
 * deliberately about *shapes* of keys rather than the values in any one .env,
 * so it catches a key that was never on this machine.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is designed to be public and is expected in
 * the bundle — a Supabase *anon* JWT carries `"role":"anon"`. A `service_role`
 * JWT carries the same shape and must never appear, so the two are told apart
 * by the decoded role claim rather than by name.

    SUPABASE'S NEW KEY FORMAT, WHICH THE JWT CHECK BELOW CANNOT SEE.

    That check tells an anon key from a service_role key by decoding the role
    claim, which is exactly right and only works on the legacy keys, because
    those are JWTs. The current format is not: a publishable key is
    `sb_publishable_…` and a secret key is `sb_secret_…`, opaque strings with
    no payload to decode. This deployment is already issuing the new format,
    so the one shape a fresh project hands out was the one shape nothing
    scanned for.

    `sb_publishable_` is deliberately absent from this list. It is designed to
    be public, it is in the bundle on purpose, and flagging it would be the
    check crying wolf on the one key that belongs there.

    `sbp_` is the management API's personal access token. It is not an
    application key at all and no code here should ever hold one, which is why
    it is worth scanning for: a token that can create and delete whole projects
    reaching a browser is the worst thing on this list.
