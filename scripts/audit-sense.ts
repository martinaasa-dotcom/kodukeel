/**
 * DOES EVERY QUESTION THIS APP ASKS MAKE SENSE FOR THE WORD IT IS ABOUT?
 *
 * `npm run audit:questions` asks the mechanical question: is the answer already
 * printed in the question. This asks the one after it, which no unit test can:
 * is the question a thing anybody would ask about *this* word.
 *
 * It exists because of a report from somebody using the app. A new word came up
 * in review, `hobune`, and the card asked for it in the sisseütlev and wanted
 * `hobusesse`. They asked Anu, who told them the ending goes on a place noun
 * and never on a person or an animal by themselves, which is right, so the app
 * had contradicted its own tutor on a card it built itself. Every animate noun
 * in the dictionary was drilled that way: `koeras`, `emasse`, `õpetajasse`, and
 * a learner who passes those cards has learned to say `ma annan raamatu
 * õpetajasse`.
 *
 * FOUR THINGS, and each is a rule with a module behind it rather than a taste.
 *
 *   1. A local case a word does not take. Estonian has two sets and a word
 *      takes one: `toas` for a room, `hobusel` for a horse, `Saksamaal` for a
 *      country. `caseFits` is the answer and `lib/estonian/semantics.ts` is
 *      where the fact comes from.
 *   2. A question word for the wrong kind of thing. A horse is a `kes`, so a
 *      card asking `hobune → millega?` is asking with the interrogative for a
 *      thing. `caseQuestionFor` is the answer.
 *   3. A place adverb on a card about one word. `kus?` is answered by the
 *      seesütlev *and* the alalütlev, so a card printing it can be answered
 *      correctly and marked wrong. It belongs in the case's name and not in a
 *      question about a word.
 *   4. A singular case asked of a word that has no singular. Nineteen entries
 *      are headed by a plural because that is the only number the word has,
 *      and Ekilex records the singular paradigm of the word underneath, so
 *      `prillid → milles?` wanted `prillis`.
 *   5. An exercise built out of something that is not a sentence.
 *      `naturalSentence` is the gate, and it was on four of the eight doors:
 *      the mock exam and the level check had it, the deck's gap-fills, the
 *      printable worksheet, the lesson planner and speaking practice did not.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It does not judge whether a question is hard, or whether the
 * word is worth teaching, or whether the wrong answers are any good, which is
 * `lib/questions/distractors.ts` and was measured separately. It asks four
 * mechanical things, which is why it can be trusted over forty thousand cards.
 *
 * No database and no network: it reads every entry the seed writes, through
 * `scripts/lib/dictionary.ts`. It used to read `prisma/data/expanded.json`
 * alone, under a comment calling that file "what the seed loads": the seed
 * loads it and `prisma/data/harvested.ts`, and 761 of the 1,514 course words
 * are in no expansion row.
