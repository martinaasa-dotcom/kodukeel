/**
 * Draft the other side's lines before anybody plays, and keep only what the
 * gate lets through.
 *
 *   npm run draft:lines                    # every scriptable beat short of WANT lines
 *   npm run draft:lines -- --scene poodi-piima
 *   npm run draft:lines -- --refresh       # drop unreviewed rows first and draft again
 *
 * ADR-025 amendment 1 (`lib/scenes/scripted.ts`). This is the composer moved
 * to a different moment: the same chain, the same prompt and the same four
 * checks as a live turn, run on a developer's machine, with the survivors
 * written into `lib/scenes/bank.ts` where the pull request is the review. A
 * native speaker's pass, when there is one, edits that file and flips
 * `reviewed`; this script never touches a row somebody has reviewed.
 *
 * WHAT IS REFUSED BEFORE THE GATE IS EVEN ASKED, and each is a way a bad line
 * would otherwise look like a good one:
 *   - a beat that is not scriptable, because its line has to name a value the
 *     card draws per run (`scriptable`);
 *   - a line holding a digit, since a number in a scripted line is a number
 *     nobody was dealt, and the gate cannot vouch for digits either way;
 *   - a line holding a dash or a colon, which is a model narrating or listing
 *     rather than speaking, and which the copy rules forbid on a screen;
 *   - a line that hands over the form the beat is about to ask for. "Kas sa
 *     tahad piima osta?" before a beat that wants `piima` is the answer printed
 *     in the question, which is the fault `npm run audit:questions` hunts on
 *     every card, and a learner who copies it out has retrieved nothing;
 *   - the way out itself, because "I did not catch that" as a scripted line
 *     is the fallback wearing a better chip;
 *   - a line of four words or more with no finite verb in it, outside the
 *     greeting and the farewell, which is the fault the gate cannot see and
 *     the first full run produced: "Kus pood praegu olema?", a
 *     `ma`-infinitive standing where "on" belongs. The retrieval rung already
 *     holds a recorded usage to that floor (`lacksFiniteVerb`);
 *   - a duplicate of a line already in the bank for that beat, spelled the
 *     same or the same once lowercased.
 *
 * AND THE RULES ARE APPLIED TO WHAT IS ALREADY THERE, on every run. An
 * unreviewed row that today's gate or today's refusals would not let in is
 * dropped and reported before anything is drafted, so a rule added after a
 * bank was written reaches the bank rather than only the next line. A row a
 * native speaker has reviewed is never touched by a script.
 *
 * A run that drafts nothing says which wall it hit rather than reporting a
 * full bank, which is the rule `eval:scene` learned the expensive way.
