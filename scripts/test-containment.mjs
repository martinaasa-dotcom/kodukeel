/**
 * Text and icons stay inside the boxes they were drawn into, measured.
 *
 * Every other rule in this repository about the shape of a page is about the
 * page as a whole: the root declares no overflow, the document cannot be
 * dragged sideways, a target clears 44px. None of them can see the fault this
 * suite is named after, because it happens *inside* a card that is itself the
 * right size. A word runs over the border and onto the ground behind it; a
 * label meets an icon in a flex row and squeezes the icon into an oval; a
 * count reaches three digits and paints outside the circle it was centered in.
 * The page never scrolls sideways for any of that, so `test-mobile.mjs` reads
 * a clean pass and the screen looks broken.
 *
 * FOUR FAULTS, AND EACH IS A DIFFERENT MISTAKE.
 *
 *   1. Something is CUT OFF. It sits inside an ancestor that clips, and part
 *      of it is past the clip: the reader is missing text and has no way to
 *      reach it. A scroller is not this fault — being able to scroll to the
 *      rest is the way out, which is why an ancestor that scrolls on an axis
 *      ends the search on that axis rather than counting as a clip.
 *
 *   2. Something BLEEDS OVER a boundary that is drawn. The nearest ancestor
 *      that paints a border or a fill is the box a reader sees, and ink
 *      outside its padding box is ink on the wrong side of a line somebody
 *      drew. Nothing clips it, so nothing is lost; it just reads as broken.
 *
 *   3. An ICON IS DEFORMED. A lucide icon is a square with `width` and
 *      `height` attributes on it, and a flex row squeezes it whenever the
 *      text beside it is longer than the row. `svg.lucide { flex: none }` in
 *      app/globals.css is the one rule that stops that, and this is what says
 *      the rule is still doing its job on a real page.
 *
 *   4. Something is DRAWN INTO SOMETHING ELSE. Not out of a box: on top of
 *      one. This is the fault that survives all three above, because both
 *      elements are inside their card and neither is cut off; one of them
 *      just cannot be read. Asked by hit-testing the letters rather than by
 *      comparing rectangles, for reasons written out where it is done.
 *
 * AND THEN THE SAME FOUR WITH NOTHING TO BREAK ON, WHICH IS THE HALF THAT
 * MATTERS. A page that holds today's words is not a page that holds text: a
 * row fits because the gloss it happens to carry has three spaces in it, and
 * a browser will break a line at a space whether or not anybody thought about
 * it. So every run of text is swapped for a run of letters OF THE SAME LENGTH
 * with no space and no hyphen anywhere in it, and the same four questions are
 * asked again.
 *
 * SAME LENGTH IS THE WHOLE DISCIPLINE OF IT. A stress test that hands every
 * element a forty-character word is unfalsifiable: a ring whose middle says
 * "42%" will fail it, and there is no markup that would pass. Same length asks
 * the question the language actually poses. Estonian compounds: "raamatukogu",
 * "sünnipäevakingitus", a unit title that is one word where the English is
 * four. The gloss "gymnasium, secondary school" fits a card today because of
 * its commas, and the compound of the same width has to fit it too. Anything
 * that fails this is a box sized by the accident of where the spaces fell.
 *
 * Needs the server running and a deck with something in it:
 *   npm run demo && npm run dev
 *   node scripts/test-containment.mjs

  1000 rather than 1020, and the twenty are a route that no longer exists.
  `/guide` was a second description of the app offered to somebody already

  being learning, and the run after the cut counted 940 where the one before
  it counted 1020. The margin of twenty under the count is the one the floor
  has always kept.

  Then 940, and this one is a raise rather than a cut. `/class/[classroomId]`
  renders two different screens, a teacher's roster and a sponsor's view of a

// 1040 rather than 920: five routes joined the sweep (the Flash cards round,

// why they had to: "a route that is not in this list is a screen where the
// whole rule is unenforced", and the calendar was over its box at 768 on the
// first run.
//
// 1050 rather than 1040: the commonest words joined it, which is one route and
// twenty checks, and it is the densest page in the app by some way. Four
// hundred Estonian chips in four disclosures, and the longest of them
// (`sellepärast`, `suurepärane`) are exactly the shape the unbreakable pass
// asks about.
// 1070 rather than 1050: Sonad joined it, which is one route and twenty
// checks. It is the tightest board in the app at 360, six circles across with
// a 32-key alphabet under them, so it is exactly the route this suite exists
// for.
// 1090 rather than 1070: the crossword joined it. Nine columns of cells with
// a clue number in each corner at 360 is the densest arrangement of small
// boxes in the app, which is what this suite is for.
// And 940 rather than 920 came the other way, with the sponsor's workplace
// group, which this suite had never drawn: `/class/[classroomId]` renders two
// different screens and only one of them was ever walked. Merged rather than
// chosen, since both sides added coverage. Measured at 1120 against a database
// with the demo fixture in it, which is what CI seeds; without `npm run demo`
// the workplace group does not exist and the run comes in at 1100 and says so,
// which is the floor doing its job rather than a regression.
//
// And 1130 rather than 1110: `/funding` joined the sweep, which is one route
// and twenty checks. It is a page of numbers in a table beside a bar chart and
// a slider, which is the one arrangement in the app whose width is decided by
// how long a figure happens to be, so it is exactly the route this suite is
// for. Measured at 1140 with the demo fixture in place, which is the 1120 above
// plus that one route, and the floor keeps the same ten under it.
//
// And then two routes rather than one, from two branches at once: `/funding`
// from that one and `/review/describe` from this. Measured at 1160 on the
// merged tree rather than added from either side, which is the same rule one
// line up, and the floor keeps the same ten under it.
//
// And then four routes rather than two, from two branches at once: the
// frequency rounds from one, and the conversations plus a state no URL reaches
// from the other. Each side set its own floor from its own two, which is
// exactly the arithmetic the line above warns about, so this is measured on the
// merged tree rather than added. The briefing at 360 is a role card over a
// two-column dial of labeled buttons; the talking screen behind it is a log of
// Estonian in a fixed-height scroller with a text field, the letter bar and four
// controls under it, which is the tightest row of buttons in the app after the
// rating keys; and `/review/common/noun` is a whole round.
//
// A PRODUCTION BUILD RATHER THAN `next dev`, which is worth writing down
// because it cost an afternoon: the dev overlay mounts a `nextjs-portal`
// element over the page, and this suite correctly reports it as drawn into the
// phone bar on every route it walks. Measuring a floor off a dev server would
// have baked that in.
// Measured at 1231 on the merged tree against a production build with the demo
// fixture in place, and the floor keeps the same ten under it.
//
// A word opened out of a teaching sentence adds five checks a pass. Measured at
// 1295 with one of the two passes waiving those five, because the deck it was
// run against had nothing left to meet by then, so a clean run is 1300 and the
// floor keeps the same ten under that. The waiver is what makes it safe to set

    AND NOTHING IS DRAWN ON TOP OF ANYTHING ELSE.

    Not out of a box: into one. Something laid over text that is otherwise
    perfectly inside its card, which every check above passes happily because
    both elements are where they belong and one of them simply cannot be read.

    ASKED BY HIT-TESTING RATHER THAN BY COMPARING RECTANGLES, and that was
    arrived at the hard way. Comparing sibling rectangles reported three
    things and none of them was this fault. An inline element that wraps has
    one bounding rectangle spanning every line it touches, so a span before it
    on line one and a span after it on line two overlap on paper with no ink
    in common at all. `getClientRects` fixes that and uncovers the next one: an
    inline whose text changes font mid-run, which here is any Estonian prompt
    with an arrow in it, reports a fragment rectangle per run plus one
    covering the lot, and those overlap each other by a pixel or ten. Excluding
    inline-level elements clears both and leaves the check blind, because the
    painted text in this app is nearly all inline: a 30px negative margin
    forced into a deck row went unreported.

    `elementFromPoint` asks the browser what is actually on top at a point,
    which is the question all along. It ignores anything `pointer-events:
    none`, so the three pastel washes behind every page are not a finding, and
    a hit on the element itself or on something it is inside is the ordinary
    answer.

    The point has to be somewhere the element is ACTUALLY PAINTED, which is
    not the same as somewhere it is laid out, and two things stood between
    those. A deck row keeps its translation to one line with `truncate`, and
    the part past the ellipsis still has a rectangle: hit-testing that
    reported the row's level chip as drawn over a translation it merely sits
    beside, so the rectangle is intersected with every ancestor that clips.
    And an inline element's own rectangle is its inline box, which for a run
    that changes font mid-way (any Estonian prompt with an arrow in it) is
    reported in fragments that reach past where the text ends. A Range over
    the text node is where the letters are, which is what this is asking
    about.

    Text inside an ELLIPSIS is left out of this one, for the same reason it is
    left out of "cut off" above: the box has said in CSS that it is stopping
    the line short, and right at that boundary the browser's own geometry for
    the runs either side of it stops agreeing with itself. A deck row's word
    and its translation are reported as occupying the same eleven pixels
    there, which is not something any markup could fix and not something a
    reader can see.

    The page is walked a screenful at a time, because a point below the fold
    cannot be hit-tested at all, and the scroll is put back afterwards so both
    passes over a page start where the last one did.

    Made to fail once, which is the only way anybody knows what a quiet check
    is saying: an absolutely positioned block was appended over one deck row
    in the browser, and this reported six things covered by it and nothing
    anywhere else on the page.

    its English and a button. No URL reaches that, and it is the densest thing
    in the smallest box on the screen, which is exactly the shape this suite
    exists for.

    Waived rather than failed where the batch has no sentence with a vouched
    word in it, because which words a deck holds is a fact about the fixture
    and not about the markup.

    A CONVERSATION IN PROGRESS, which no URL reaches.

    `/situations/[id]` loads on the briefing and the talking screen replaces it
    in place, so the sweep above measures the card and the dial and never the
    thing they lead to: a log of Estonian in a fixed-height scroller, a text
    field, the letter bar, and four controls in a row, which at 360 is the
    tightest row of buttons in the app after the rating keys.

    Pressed until it lands rather than waited on, for the reason
    `test-scene.mjs` gives at length: a button rendered on the server is
    clickable and inert, so a single click into a hydrating page is swallowed
    and waiting longer cannot recover it.
