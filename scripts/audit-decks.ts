/**
 * THE CARDS A DECK KEPT AFTER THE BUILDER STOPPED MAKING THEM.
 *
 * Two faults, both of them the same shape. `lib/srs/cards.ts` refuses to build
 * either card now, and a generator fix settles the cards built from now on and
 * not one card already in a deck: a `Card` row carries its own front, back and
 * `targetCase`, and nothing in this app rewrites one. So it comes back due, it
 * is answered, the scheduler reads the pass as a recall and pushes the interval
 * out, and the slot is spent for ever on a question that should not be asked.
 * A generator fix that leaves the rows it used to write is half a fix.
 *
 * ONE — A CARD THAT PRINTS ITS OWN ANSWER. Estonian genuinely spells some cases
 * like the nominative: `liblikas` has the genitive `liblika`, so its seesütlev
 * is `liblika` plus `s`, which is `liblikas` again, and the same holds for
 * `kapsas`, `lusikas`, `maasikas`, `rahvas`, `taevas` and 109 more. The card
 * read `liblikas → milles? kus?` with `liblikas` on the back. Nobody can get
 * one wrong.
 *
 * TWO — A CARD ASKING A CASE THE WORD DOES NOT TAKE. Reported by a learner, on
 * the daily quest: `isa → milles? kus?` with `isas` on the back. Estonian picks
 * between two whole sets of local cases on a fact about meaning, so a room goes
 * `toas` and a father goes `isal`, and `isas` is not a way of saying anything.
 * This one is worse than the first, because the first is a card nobody can fail
 * and this is a card you can only pass by learning something untrue: somebody
 * who gets it right has learned to say `ma annan raamatu õpetajasse`, and the
 * app has contradicted the teacher whose class they are sitting in. The same
 * rule catches a word with no singular, where the form asked for belongs to
 * another word entirely (`prillid → milles?` wanting `prillis`).
 *
 * `lib/srs/retire.ts` holds the second rule, and what it asks is **is the form
 * on the back one Estonian does not use**, which is not the same question as
 * "would the builder build this". The first version of it asked the second, on
 * the argument that the audit's test and the builder's test should be one
 * function, and the production database that reported the original fault is
 * what showed the difference. `localCasesFor` reads "we do not know" as the
 * inside trio, which is the right default for a builder and backwards for a
 * deletion: on a deployment seeded before `semanticTypes` was filled, that
 * rule condemned every correct *outside* card in the database. 6,952 entries,
 * none of them classified, 318 cards named for removal, and every one of them
 * right: `isa → isale`, `õpetaja → õpetajale`, `arst → arstile`. Silence is
 * never evidence. See the header there for what counts as evidence instead.
 *
 * A COMMAND SOMEBODY RUNS, NOT SOMETHING THE APP DOES, because every row it
 * touches belongs to a learner. It reports by default and names every card it
 * would remove; `--write` removes them. `.github/workflows/audit-decks.yml` is
 * the same thing with a button on it, for an operator with a deployment and no
 * checkout.
 *
 * REMOVING RATHER THAN SUSPENDING, and the schema is what makes that safe.
 * `Review` has no foreign key to `Card` and carries its own `ownerId` and
 * `lexemeId`, deliberately, so deleting a card cannot cascade the history
 * away: what the learner did is kept and only the unanswerable question goes.
 * Suspending would leave it in the deck counts and on the suspended list,
 * which is a row somebody has to decide about later, about a card that can
 * never be right.
 *
 * THREE — A BARE ASK NO SENTENCE CAN REPLACE. `ravim → millele? kuhu?` was
 * reported as pointless by a learner: nothing on it says when anybody would
 * say `ravimile`. The builder makes a case card out of a recorded sentence now,
 * and `repairCaseFronts` in `prisma/repair.ts` rewrites the old cards into that
 * shape wherever the dictionary has a sentence naming the case, on the next
 * seed. What is left is a card the builder would not build and cannot rebuild,
 * because no lexicographer recorded the word in that case. `unsentencedCaseCards`
 * in `lib/srs/retire.ts` names those. Run the seed first, or this reports every
 * bare card that a seed would have rewritten as well as the ones it cannot.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO IS BUILD THE RIGHT CARD IN ITS PLACE. Adding rows to a
 * stranger's deck is a larger claim than taking an unanswerable question out
 * of it, and the word is still in the dictionary with its own entry, its own
 * case table and a button that adds it back. The same line `prisma/repair.ts`
 * draws about scheduling columns: a repair may not cost somebody progress.
 *
 * Needs a database in DATABASE_URL. Never point it at one you are not willing
 * to write to, and read the report before passing `--write`.
