/**
 * The loop that starts at a dead end and ends in the dictionary, driven for
 * real.
 *
 * The pieces are tested elsewhere: the grouping and the patch shapes in
 * `lib/suggestions/model.test.ts`, the writes in `apply.itest.ts`, the queue's
 * counts and its "what does the entry say now" column in `queue.itest.ts`.
 * What none of those can see is whether the loop closes. That is the only
 * claim this feature makes and every part of it is in a different process: a
 * button on a failure, a server action, a review queue, a write to shared
 * reference data, and the same learner being told what happened.
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= npm run dev
 *   node scripts/test-suggestions.mjs
 *
 * It runs against local mode, where the single learner is also the reviewer,
 * for the reason every browser suite here does: driving a Google sign-in from
 * Playwright is not a test of anything this app owns.
 *
 * It writes and deletes rows, so `requireLocalDatabase` guards it, and its
 * cleanup is scoped to the one invented word it touches rather than to
 * everything in the queue: a broad delete would be fine on a scratch database
 * and would quietly throw away somebody's reports on their own.
