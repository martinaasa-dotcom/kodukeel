/**
 * Synthetic learners with real-sized histories, for measuring.
 *
 * Every performance claim this repository could make was measured against a
 * demo deck of 417 reviews, which is a fortnight of one person. The queries
 * that matter here derive progress from the whole review log on every page
 * load (ADR-014), so the interesting question is what they cost after a year,
 * and 417 rows cannot answer it: Postgres will happily sequential-scan a
 * table that small faster than it can use an index.
 *
 * This writes learners whose logs are the size a real one becomes. It is
 * deliberately separate from `demo-data.ts`, which exists to make the screens
 * look right and is tuned for that.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/load-fixture.ts --learners 60 --reviews 6000
 *   npx tsx scripts/load-fixture.ts --clean
 *
 * Local databases only, by the same guard as every other destructive script.
