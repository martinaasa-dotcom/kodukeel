/**
 * Harvest the syllabus vocabulary from Ekilex.
 *
 * This is the script that lets the course be wide without anybody writing
 * Estonian. The syllabus names words and glosses them in English; every Estonian
 * character in the result comes back from Ekilex — principal parts, CEFR level,
 * verb government, and the attested sentences the gap-fill, dictation and
 * sentence-building modes are built from.
 *
 * The important property is the direction of authority. A lemma in the syllabus
 * is a *request*, not a fact: if Ekilex does not know it, or knows it with
 * forms that do not match the part of speech we asked for, it is dropped
 * and reported. So a word this project has misspelled or imagined cannot reach
 * the dictionary — it can only fail to arrive, loudly. That is the mechanical
 * version of ADR-005, and it is why the vocabulary could grow by an order of
 * magnitude in one pass without a single generated form.
 *
 * Only principal parts are written. Everything else Ekilex returns is deliberately
 * *not* stored: the regular cases are derived from the genitive stem at render
 * time, and a word is upgraded to its authoritative Ekilex forms the first
 * time somebody looks at it. Storing all of it here would be the second source
 * of truth the schema notes forbid.
 *
 *   tsx scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts            # harvest anything not cached
 *   tsx scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts --refresh  # ignore the cache, re-ask
 *   tsx scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts --only=kodu
 *
 * Needs EKILEX_API_KEY. Responses are cached under .ekilex-cache/ so a re-run
 * costs nothing and the generated file is reproducible.

      AND THE FORMS NO RULE REACHES, WHICH THE DICTIONARY HAS TO HOLD.

      ADR-005 amendment 1 lets a deterministic rule build a form off a stored
      one, and the rules are real: ten case endings on a genitive stem, six
      persons on a stored first person. What they are not is complete, and a
      deployment without an Ekilex key has nothing else. `olema` showed `olen`
      and stopped, so the commonest verb in the language could not answer
      `olevik · ta`; no verb at all could answer `lihtminevik · ta`, because
      the simple past is not derivable and may not be; and every pronoun's
      short case forms, which is what an Estonian sentence is actually made of,
      were absent, so the pronoun unit shipped with no case cards rather than
      teach `minule` and mark `mulle` wrong.

      The rules are asked which slots they miss rather than told: a list of
      exceptions kept beside the exceptions is two copies of one fact, and this
      one would go stale silently. Stored under `EKILEX:<code>`, which is the
      spelling `conjugatedForms`, `stemsFrom` and `conjugationAnswer` already
      read for a form the seed retrieved, so nothing downstream had to learn a
      new shape.

      They stay `isPrincipal` on the way into the database, which the seed
      decides and this only has to not break: `runEnrich` reads a non-principal
      form as "this entry has been enriched", so a seed writing one would strand
      every reseeded word half-upgraded. See the note on `runEnrich`.
