/**
 * DOES THE GLOSS DESCRIBE THE WORD WHOSE FORMS ARE STORED BESIDE IT?
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-homonyms.ts            # every built entry
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-homonyms.ts --write    # and apply the pins a person has made
 *   npx tsx scripts/audit-homonyms.ts --limit 50 # a sample
 *
 * The built dictionary is a join: Wiktionary supplies the English gloss and
 * Ekilex supplies the Estonian forms, and the two are joined on the spelling.
 * Ekilex numbers its homonyms and `scripts/expand-seed.ts` takes the first
 * exact match, which is the fault `scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts` fixed for the
 * course vocabulary and reported at length: 87 of the course's 1,185 words have
 * more than one exact match, and six came back as a different word entirely,
 * `kohus` as a court carrying the forms of a moral duty among them. The harvest
 * pins those. Nothing checked the other four thousand.
 *
 * IT IS CHECKABLE, BECAUSE THE PAGE THE GLOSS CAME OFF SAYS WHICH WORD IT IS.
 * A Wiktionary Estonian block opens with `{{et-noun|<genitive>|<partitive>}}`,
 * so the same block that supplied the gloss declares two of the three principal
 * parts. `iga` is `{{et-noun|ea|iga}}` for the noun meaning age and a
 * determiner meaning every; `kohus` carries `{{et-noun|kohtu|kohut}}` and
 * `{{et-noun|kohuse|kohust}}` on one page. Comparing those two strings with the
 * two the dictionary stores is a mechanical check on the join, from a source
 * this app already trusts for the gloss.
 *
 * A HOMONYM IS RESOLVED BY A PERSON OR REPORTED, NEVER GUESSED THROUGH, which
 * is the rule `scripts/harvest-ekilex.ts` arrived at for the course and the
 * reason this reports rather than repairs. Wiktionary cannot settle it on its
 * own: it is often thinner than Ekilex and 88 of the 96 disagreements are its
 * own slips on obscure words, `kasutamiset` for a partitive that is
 * `kasutamist`. Picking automatically was tried and is worse than it looks.
 * `aste` really does have two nouns and the page declares both, so the rule
 * moved a B1 entry off `aste : astme : astet`, which is the word
 * `astmevaheldus` is built on, and onto a rarer one that matched the block the
 * gloss came from. Consistent, and not what a learner wants.
 *
 * So the report names, for each disagreement, the Ekilex word whose principal
 * parts *are* the ones the page declares, and a person puts that number in
 * `prisma/data/homonym-pins.json`. `--write` re-maps a pinned entry from that
 * word exactly as `scripts/expand-seed.ts` would have mapped it, keeping the
 * English gloss and the part of speech, because those came from Wiktionary and
 * are not what was wrong.
 *
 * A repoint is a change to the whole entry, not to two strings: the forms, the
 * sentences, the CEFR level, the gradation and the Institute's own semantic
 * type all belong to whichever homonym was taken, so all of them are re-read
 * from the one that was pinned.
 *
 * Needs the network, and `--write` needs EKILEX_API_KEY. Pages are cached
 * under `prisma/data/.cache/` in the same file `npm run audit:glosses` fills,
 * so running one after the other costs Wiktionary nothing.
