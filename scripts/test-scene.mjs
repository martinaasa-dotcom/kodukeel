/**
 * A whole conversation, played through, in a browser.
 *
 * The pieces have tests of their own and none of them can see this. `turn.ts`
 * marks a turn, `state.ts` advances a scene, `grades.ts` decides what reaches
 * the review log, `line.ts` walks the ladder, `catalogue.test.ts` holds the
 * scenes to what their units teach, and `scene.itest.ts` asks a real dictionary
 * whether a scene can be built at all. What none of them can answer is whether
 * the loop closes, and the loop here is six processes: a page, a server action
 * that draws and writes a run, a route that marks every turn and walks the
 * ladder, a client that never decides anything, a second marking of the same
 * transcript when it ends, and a debrief built out of that.
 *
 *   npm run dev
 *   node scripts/test-scene.mjs
 *
 * Written after four faults that only this could have found, which is the
 * argument for it rather than a note about its history. Three of the four
 * looked exactly like an app with nothing in it: the route returned a line
 * without saying which beat it was on, so "Say it" was disabled for the whole
 * run; the rate limiter's verdict was returned as though it were a `Response`,
 * so every turn was a 500; and the role card told a learner to read a word off
 * a place on the card where nothing was printed.
 *
 * IT RUNS IN WHATEVER STATE THE SERVER IS IN, and reports which. A composed
 * line needs a provider key and CI has none, so a suite that required one would
 * be a suite CI could not run and a suite that assumed none would fail on
 * anybody's own machine. `e2e.mjs` already answers this by asking the page what
 * it is showing rather than telling it, and the ladder is the same shape: what
 * every state shares is that a line arrives, it says where it came from, and
 * the scene can be finished.

  shows it landed, and the failure then means the button really is dead.
