  These three checks need `tuba` to open the seeded noun, and until recently
  that was not something this suite could count on. `Lexeme` is unique on
  `[lemma, pos]`, so a suite that ticks an unvouched word already in the
  dictionary leaves a second row under the same lemma with no paradigm behind
  it. `test-containment.mjs` did exactly that with `tuba`, and CI runs it two
  steps before this. What that cost was not one failed check: `waitForSelector`
  threw, the suite died before check one, and a whole run reported a Playwright
  timeout instead of a cause.

  So the wait is a question now. A dictionary with no `tuba` at all is a
  database nobody seeded, which is an honest absence and waives its checks. A
  `tuba` that opens without a paradigm is something shadowing it, which is a
  fault and says so in a sentence naming the likely culprit.
