    A DECK A BEGINNER COULD PLAUSIBLY HAVE, WHICH THIS HAD QUIETLY STOPPED BEING.

    It took the alphabetically first thirty nouns and verbs in the dictionary,
    and that was a fair sample of a 360-word seed. The harvest and the built
    expansion took the dictionary past five thousand words and nobody re-read
    what "alphabetically first" now meant: `aabe`, `aadressiraamat`, `aamissepp`,
    `aardelaegas`, `aatomipomm`, `aberratsioon`, `abieluvaraleping`. A treasure
    chest, an atom bomb, an aberration and a prenuptial agreement, in the deck
    of somebody eight weeks into A1.

    That is not only untidy. This fixture is what every screenshot shows, what
    every browser suite reviews, and what the grammar reference draws its "in
    real words" table from, so the app demonstrated itself in vocabulary that
    argued against it.

    The course's own A1 nouns and verbs instead, which is 244 words to draw
    thirty from and gives `aitama`, `algama`, `alustama`, `andma`, `armastama`,
    `armastus`, `arst`, `auto`, `buss`, `elama`, `ema`, `hommik`. Still
    alphabetical, so the deck is the same deck on every run, which is what the
    suites need. Which four of them get the whole card range is decided below
    by what they can carry, not by where they sort.

    The query cannot silently widen again: a word is in this deck because the
    syllabus put it there and marked it A1, rather than because of where it

    THE RICH WORDS ARE FOUR THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE WHAT THE SUITES READ.

    This gave the whole card range to `i < 4`, the first four alphabetically,
    and then to the first four carrying a genitive singular, because a genitive
    stem was what a case card needed. Both were a stand-in for the question
    `availableCardTypes` asks, and both went stale the moment the answer moved:
    the first version laid down a deck with **no case-form cards at all**, since
    the first five words this query returns are verbs and a verb has no genitive
    singular.

    A genitive stem is no longer the answer either. A case is drilled in a
    sentence that uses it, so `detsember` builds a seesütlev card and `aadress`
    builds nothing, and reading a stem would put this fixture back exactly where
    it was. The builder is asked instead, which is the only version of this that
    cannot go stale again: whatever decides a case card tomorrow decides this.

    AND IT NAMES THE SLOTS THE SUITES NEED RATHER THAN HOPING FOR THEM. Two
    checks read a specific case off this deck and neither can say so for itself:
    `test-teaching.mjs` drills `/review?case=INESSIVE`, and the answer-time
    panel on Progress only draws where one slot is slow, which is `SLOW_SLOT`.
    Picking the first four case-capable words gives arvuti, auto, buss and
    detsember, which covers the first by luck and misses the second, and a
    fixture that covers a suite by luck is a suite that fails the day the
    dictionary shifts under it. Each named slot gets a word chosen for it, the
    rest fill up to four, and a slot nothing can demonstrate stops the run and
    says which.
