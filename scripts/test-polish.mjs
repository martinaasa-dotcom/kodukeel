  Two entries for one word, and both of them reachable.

  A lemma can hold more than one entry, because `@@unique` is on `(lemma, pos)`:
  `hall` is gray and also frost. The entry page shows one of them, listed the
  rest under "other matches", and navigated those chips to `?q=<lemma>` — which
  searched the same word, opened the same winner, and left the second entry
  unreachable from anywhere in the app. The chips also read lemma and gloss
  alone, so two of them said nearly the same thing twice and one looked like a
  rendering fault.

  Driven rather than reasoned about, because the whole bug was that the button
  looked right and did nothing.

  THE CHIP IS FOUND BY ITS LEMMA, EXACTLY, AND THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS WAS NOT.

  It asked for the first button whose text started with "vana", which in CI was
  `vanaadium`, vanadium: a different word that shares five letters. So the check
  about the label failed on a chip it was never about, and the one after it went
  green for opening an entry that was indeed a different entry. Prefix-matching
  the thing under test is the same fault as the bug this block exists for, one
  layer up, which is a good reason to say exactly what you mean.

  The precondition is stated rather than assumed, and it is the real one: not
  "are there other matches", since searching a short word finds longer ones
  whatever else is true, but "is one of them this same word". A database
  holding one entry cannot show any of this, and a suite that clicks a chip
  that is not there waits thirty seconds and then fails in Playwright's words
  rather than in ones that name the cause.

  AND IT NO LONGER NAMES THE WORD, BECAUSE THE WORD MOVED.

  This asked about `vana`, which shipped as a pair when it was written. Open
  question Q8 has since been answered: the builder reads a word's part of
  speech off the sense its gloss came from, 61 labels were corrected, and a
  fresh seed now holds two pairs rather than thirteen. `vana` is one entry, so
  this block waived its three checks and would have gone on waiving them for
  ever, which is a check that has quietly stopped looking.

  So it asks for what it is actually about: a lemma this dictionary holds
  twice. `hall` and `rõõmus` are what a fresh seed ships, and `tuba` is what
  `test-containment` makes by confirming a scanned word, which is the path that
  produces a pair for any word at all and the one no upstream correction
  reaches. The first that is really a pair is the one driven, and its name is
  printed so a reader knows which. Only when none of them is does it waive.
