/**
 * THE FLASH ROUND, DRIVEN, AND THE LISTS IT MOVES.
 *
 * Everything about the round that can be decided without a browser is decided
 * in `lib/games/flash.test.ts`: which slots a word can be asked, which shapes
 * each slot can carry, and what every kind of answer is worth. What none of
 * that can see is the half a learner touches, and it is the half where this
 * feature has already been wrong twice in one afternoon of driving it. The
 * first real round asked for the sisseütlev seven times out of ten, because
 * the page took the first open case and the traditional order starts there;
 * the second asked `Venemaa → milles? kus?`, which is the fault
 * `lib/estonian/place.ts` exists to prevent, arriving through a new door.
 * Neither was visible to a unit test, because neither is about one word.
 *
 * So this drives the round the way somebody would:
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= npm start
 *   node scripts/test-flash.mjs
 *
 * It walks a whole round answering wrongly, which is what makes the correct
 * answer available: the marking prints the form the dictionary holds. Then it
 * reloads and answers with what it was told, and asserts the thing this whole
 * change is about, that the log records *which form* the answer was about.
 * Before `Review.slot`, every one of those rows would have gone down as an
 * answer about whatever the card happened to be.
 *
 * It writes reviews, which is what a learner does, and it deletes the ones it
 * wrote. `requireLocalDatabase` guards that like every other script here that
 * removes a row.

  minutes ago holds rows dated later this evening than this suite started: they
  came back as answers this round had supposedly given, they carry no slot
  because nothing asked them for one, and the check reported 24 rows missing
  one. Worse, the tidy-up at the end deletes what this query returns, so a run
