/**
 * The backup-and-restore round trip, tested against the real database.
 *
 * This suite deletes everything and puts it back, which is the only honest way
 * to test a restore — and also the most dangerous thing in this repository. Two
 * guards, because the review log is the one table whose loss is unrecoverable:
 *
 * 1. `requireLocalDatabase()` refuses anything but a local database, and hands
 *    back the URL it approved so the connection that was checked is the one
 *    that gets opened (see scripts/lib/local-db.mjs).
 * 2. It writes the export to disk *before* deleting, and stops if that fails.
 *    If the suite then crashes half way — a dev server hiccup is enough, and it
 *    happened twice while this was being written — the data is still on disk
 *    and `Settings → Restore` puts it back.
