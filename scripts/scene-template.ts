/**
 * Write the spreadsheet a native speaker fills in.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AS A SCRIPT AND NOT AS A DOCUMENT. The ask is "write one
 * Estonian sentence for each of these pictures", and the pictures are in
 * `lib/collections/scenes.ts`. A template typed by hand would be a second copy
 * of that table and would go stale the first time a scene changed, so it is
 * generated, the way the recipients list on /privacy is generated from the
 * deployment's own configuration rather than described in the abstract.
 *
 * WHAT THE CONTRIBUTOR SEES. The situation in English, the three emoji as they
 * appear on screen, the three Estonian words with their glosses, and an empty
 * column. Everything they need to write the sentence, and nothing that tells
 * them what to write: the point of the exercise is that many sentences are
 * right, and a template carrying a suggestion would collect that suggestion
 * back sixty times.
 *
 * The row keeps any sentence already contributed, so re-running this after an
 * import gives a spreadsheet of what is left rather than a blank one.
 *
 * Reads the dictionary for the glosses, because a gloss copied into this file
 * would be a second copy of the dictionary and would go stale the first time
 * somebody corrected one, which is the argument `lib/collections/frequency.ts`
 * makes about itself.
