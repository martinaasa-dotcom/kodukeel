  A rename rewrites the cards that *show the headword*, and only those.

  This used to assert that every card for the entry mentioned the new lemma,
  which held while a word had two cards, recognition and production, both of
  which are the headword against its translation. It stopped holding when the
  dictionary grew example sentences: a cloze card's front is an attested
  Estonian sentence and its back is an inflected form, and neither names the
  headword. Rewriting one to match a rename would be the app editing Estonian,
  which is the rule the whole project is built on.

  So the rule, stated properly: no card is left showing the old headword, and
  the new one is actually on the cards that carry a headword. Exact equality
  rather than a substring, because "kohvi" contains "kohv". The second check
  states the other half explicitly, so that "leaves the gap-fill alone" is
  asserted rather than merely implied by the first one passing.
