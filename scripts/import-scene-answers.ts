/**
 * Turn a filled-in `scene-sentences.csv` into `lib/collections/sceneAnswers.ts`.
 *
 * THE FOURTH DOOR ONTO ONE RULE. A photographed page, a news headline and a
 * frequency corpus all bring in Estonian this project did not write, and all
 * three answer to the same gate: the outside source proposes and the
 * dictionary decides (ADR-021, ADR-024). A native speaker typing sentences
 * into a spreadsheet is the fourth, and gets no exception for being a native
 * speaker. Every word of every sentence goes through `matchEstonianForm` at
 * the confidence a scanned page has to clear, and a sentence carrying one word
 * the dictionary will not vouch for is **reported and not written**.
 *
 * WHY THAT IS NOT AN INSULT TO THE CONTRIBUTOR. What it catches is a typo, a
 * dropped diacritic and a word the dictionary has never heard of, and the last
 * of those is the interesting one: a sentence a learner is shown as a model
 * answer should be made of words that learner can look up. A sentence rejected
 * here is a sentence to discuss, which is why the report names the word rather
 * than the row.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED. Whether the sentence is *good*, whether it
 * describes the picture, and whether the grammar is right. No machine here can
 * judge any of those and no model is asked to: the contributor is the
 * authority on their own language, which is the entire reason for asking a
 * person rather than generating one.
 *
 * Writes the file whole, sorted, so re-running gives the same bytes and a diff
 * shows only what changed.
