/**
 * Phase 0 of `docs/21-situations.md`: how much of a conversation the dictionary
 * can already say.
 *
 *   npm run measure:scenes
 *   npm run measure:scenes -- --top 40      # more of the missing-word list
 *   npm run measure:scenes -- --scene arsti-aeg
 *
 * The whole Situations design rests on one number nobody had. Where a recorded
 * Ekilex usage fits a beat, the other side's line is attested: it costs a
 * query, needs no model, needs no gate, and works on a deployment with no key.
 * Where none fits, a model composes one inside a closed word list and four
 * checks decide whether the learner ever sees it. So the share of beats that
 * retrieval can fill is the share of the feature that is free and safe, and
 * until it is measured, every estimate of the cost, the risk and the shape of
 * the first build is a guess.
 *
 * This reads the shipped dictionary from the same files `prisma/seed.ts` reads,
 * so "the dictionary" here means what a fresh install actually has. No network,
 * no database, no key. It reports rather than passes or fails: a coverage
 * figure is an input to a decision, not a check somebody can break.
