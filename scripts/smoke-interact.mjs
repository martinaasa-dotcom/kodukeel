  button that was not there: thirty seconds of Playwright waiting, a throw, and
  the eight checks after it never running, all reported as one failure naming a
  regex. It cost a real investigation on a suite with nothing wrong with it.

  So the precondition is read rather than assumed, and a deck that cannot ask
  the question waives its three checks with the reason on screen. See
