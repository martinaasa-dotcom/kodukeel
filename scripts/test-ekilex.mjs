  Matched without regard to case, because the rule is that both names are there
  and the Estonian one leads, not that the Latin one is capitalized. It used to
  ask for "Comitative", and when the Estonian name took the lead the English one
  became a small italic cross-reference set in lower case, so this check had been
  failing on correct markup ever since. Nobody saw it: this suite needs a real
  Ekilex key and the network, so CI never runs it (scripts/lib/suites.mjs), and
  an on-demand suite reports on the code it was written against.
