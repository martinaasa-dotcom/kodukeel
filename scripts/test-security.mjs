/*
  THE SECURITY PROPERTIES, ASSERTED AGAINST A RUNNING SERVER.

  `scripts/test-invariants.ts` reads the source and can tell you that
  `middleware.ts` mentions `isSameOriginMutation`. It cannot tell you that a
  forged POST is actually refused, because that depends on the order the
  middleware runs its branches, on which paths the matcher covers, and on what
  the platform does to a response on the way out. Every one of those has been
  wrong here before: the CSP had to move into the middleware because the static
  headers miss the files the matcher skips, and the gate had to move above the
  auth branch because a redirect keeps the method and the body.

  So this asks the server. HTTP rather than a browser, because none of it needs
  a DOM and a suite that does not launch Chromium is one that runs in seconds
  and cannot be flaky about a page load.

  WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a penetration test and must never be described as
  one in anything a buyer reads. It is a regression suite over the controls
  this project already claims, written by the same people who wrote them, so it
  cannot find the class of fault where the whole model is wrong. `docs/27-security.md`
  says so in its own words, and says that no external test has been done. What
  this catches is the thing that actually happens: a header quietly dropped, a
  route added without a cap, a refusal that stops refusing.

  MODE MATTERS AND IS DETECTED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. With no Supabase keys the
  app is one local learner and every route answers; with them, everything is
  gated and most of these routes refuse before they reach their own code. Both
  are correct, and each can check things the other cannot, so the suite asks
  which it is looking at and waives what that mode genuinely cannot reach.
  `scripts/test-signin.mjs` is the one that makes its own hosted build.

  whichever instance answers and whichever suite spends it. `test-restore.mjs`
  runs later in this same CI job and needs three of them, so two spent here
  would leave one, and a suite that quietly rations another suite is worse than
  a suite that checks one route fewer. `/api/reminder` is owner-scoped, is one
