  THE LANDING PAGE'S FOUR LETTERS TOUCH THE CARD, AND NOTHING THE CARD SAYS.

  õ, ä, ö and ü are tucked over the case explorer's four sides, one to a side,
  which is the whole of what makes them read as placed rather than scattered.
  They used to hang off the hero's flashcard; that card went when the page was
  cut to five screens, and they moved to the only object left big enough to
  carry them, which is also the one whose contents are the letters themselves.

  Nothing else can see any of this. They are absolutely positioned, so
  test-containment skips them by design, and a square that misses the card is
  drawn exactly as correctly as one that meets it.

  WHAT THEY MAY NOT TOUCH IS ANYTHING THE CARD SAYS, and that is a wider rule
  than the one it replaces. On the flashcard it was a single named pill in the
  footer. Here the card is a table of Estonian forms whose row count changes
  when the reader presses a chip, so the check is against every run of text and
  every control inside it, and against the glyphs rather than the boxes: a
  heading's box spans its whole column, so a box comparison reports a letter
  sitting quietly in the padding as if it were drawn over the words. Measured
  with `Range.getClientRects`, which bounds the ink.

  It earned itself immediately. The first placement put õ over "Try a word" at
  every width and ä and ü over a form and a case name at 640, where the card
  stacks into one column and brings its content out to both edges. None of it
  was visible in a screenshot at 1280.

  READ ACROSS THE WHOLE WANDER rather than where the letters happen to rest.
  Each drifts on its own clock, so there is no single frame that is the worst
  for all four, and a resting position with three pixels of clearance is not a
  placement that holds. Every letter is stepped through twelve frames of its
  own cycle and measured at each, which is also what keeps the wander honest: a
  letter given a generous keyframe leaves the card, or lands on a word, at some
  frame the eye would have to be quick to catch.

  Three widths, because the offsets change at `sm` and because the card is a
  different shape below `md`: 707px tall and single-column at 640, about 440
  and two columns above it.

  THE SLANT SURVIVES THE ANIMATION BEING TAKEN AWAY, which is the only form of

  It used to be asked by reading `rotate` off a letter mid-wander and failing on
  exactly 0. That can never fire. The wander rocks each letter by `--drift-turn`
  about its declared angle, so a letter that has lost its slant entirely reads
  0.22deg at one frame and -1.32deg at another, and never the 0 the check was
  watching for. Measured that way here, with `--float-tilt` deliberately deleted
  from one letter: four passes, no failure, on a page where a quarter of the
  ornament was broken.

  So the animation is actually stopped, the way a reader who asked for less
  motion stops it. `prefers-reduced-motion` shortens every animation in this app
  to 0.01ms with no fill, so whatever is left is what the element declares for
  itself, which is the whole reason the slant is a `rotate` property rather than
  a keyframe.

  THE HERO'S ARITHMETIC AGAINST THE NAV IT IS UNDER, AND ONE GAP DOWN THE PAGE.

  `--landing-nav` on `.hero-open` is a typed constant standing in for something
  drawn on screen, which is the shape that drifts: raise the nav's padding or
  put a taller control in the pill and the headline is that much nearer it. The
  nav is the same height at every width this app is drawn at, because the pill
  is sized by the button in it rather than by anything that reflows, so one
  measurement is the whole check. A pixel of slack for a fractional layout.

  The hero used to fill the window less a peek band and this checked the band:
  the next section started above the fold and its heading was still arriving
  at it. That rule left 230px of nothing under the claims on a 900px window
  while every other pair of sections stood 160 apart, so the page has one
  distance now and this checks the distance. Every consecutive pair of beats
  in `main`, and the footer after the close, stand exactly `--section-gap`
  apart, measured from the bottom of one to the top of the next, so a section
  that grows a padding of its own or a wrapper that adds a margin fails here
  rather than reading as a page that breathes unevenly.
*/

/*
  The last two are the boundary of the display step, one pixel apart, because a
  rule taken on two axes is a rule with a corner and the corner is where it is
  wrong. 88px of headline over a 19px paragraph needs both the width for its
  longest line and the height for the column. Asserting the size at 1000x740
  and 1000x739 is asserting that the height half of the condition is really
  there, which a check at one comfortable desktop size cannot see.
