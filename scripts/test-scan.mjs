/**
 * The paper-to-deck path, driven for real.
 *
 * Everything about reading a photograph that can be tested without a provider
 * is tested elsewhere: the parsing of a hostile reply in `lib/scan/*.test.ts`,
 * the confidence floor on a match in `lib/dict/search.test.ts`, and the
 * inflected-form resolution against a real dictionary in
 * `lib/dict/resolveScan.itest.ts`. What none of those can see is the half a
 * learner actually touches: the picture leaving the device, the confirmation
 * list, and a ticked word turning into a card the review session then asks
 * about.
 *
 * So the model is the one thing stubbed here. `/api/scan` is intercepted and
 * answered with a fixed page: one word the dictionary vouches for, and one it
 * has never seen. Everything after that point is the real app, the real server
 * actions and the real database.
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL= NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY= \
 *   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=stubbed-by-the-test npm run dev
 *   node scripts/test-scan.mjs
 *
 * The key may be nonsense: the route it would authenticate is never reached.
 * It has to be *present*, because with no provider configured at all the page
 * correctly offers no camera to point at anything.
 *
 * It writes two rows and deletes them again, scoped to the two words it
 * touches, so `requireLocalDatabase` guards it like every other script here
 * that deletes anything.

  Bring the card to its ratings, whichever of the three shapes it is.

  A page can name a word the learner already studies, and drilling the page
  draws in their existing cards for it on purpose: a page is references rather
  than copies. Such a card has a history, so it is not new, and it opens the
  way any review card does. That is one of three shapes, and this waited for
  the ratings as though it were always the fourth: a card with no answer to
  turn over at all.

  Which shape you get here depends on which seeded word this suite picks, and
  it picks the alphabetically first, which is a question about the database's
  collation rather than about the app. Locally that was a word the demo deck
  had never seen, so the card was new and opened straight on the ratings; in
  CI it is one the deck already holds, so it opened as multiple choice and
  this waited twenty seconds for buttons that were one keypress away.
  Reproduced by giving the local word a reviewed card, at which point it
  failed here every time as well.

  `smoke-offline.mjs` learned this first and its comment says why in full: the
  shapes are chosen per card, so a driver that knows only "Show answer"
  silently stops testing anything the day another shape comes up first, and
  what changed there was the dictionary growing.

  This kept its own copy on the reason that the other one goes on to grade and
  this has to stop at the ratings in order to count them. That reason is gone:
  `scripts/lib/review.mjs` reveals and never grades, which is exactly this, and
  the grade is one line in the caller that wants it. `test-containment.mjs` is
  why it exists, having waived ten checks on the claim that a deck holding
  forty due cards had nothing due.

  What the assertion below wants is that a scanned word reaches the *ordinary*
  review session and can be answered there, rather than some path of its own.
  It used to say that by counting four rating buttons, which stopped being what
  the ordinary session looks like: the app marks what it can mark now, so a
  typed answer and a pick grade themselves, a miss and a first meeting offer one
  way on, and only a flip card asks the learner, in two options rather than
  four. Counting buttons was always a proxy; what it stands for is that the
  session got to the point of taking an answer for this card.
