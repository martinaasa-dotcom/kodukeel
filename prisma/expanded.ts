/**
 * The built-in dictionary beyond the words somebody typed by hand.
 *
 * `prisma/data/expanded.json` is built by `scripts/expand-seed.ts`: Estonian
 * forms and sentences from Ekilex, English glosses from Wiktionary, nothing
 * from a model. It exists because 370 hand-written words is a demo rather than
 * a dictionary, and everything that reads the dictionary was bounded by it:
 * offline review, the minimal-pair finder, the government drill, and a
 * learner's first search for a word they met in class.
 *
 * IT IS WRITTEN AS A CACHE WARM-UP, NOT AS PART OF THE SEED, AND THE
 * DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE DESIGN HERE.
 *
 * `columns.ts` lists `examples`, `provenance`, `ekilexWordId` and `fetchedAt`
 * as columns the seed must never write, because they belong to the Ekilex
 * cache and to the learner, and reloading the built-in words has no business
 * overwriting them. That rule is about *re*seeding. These rows are the same
 * data the cache would have fetched on demand, just fetched in advance, so
 * they are inserted with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and never update anything.
 *
 * The consequences are the ones that matter: a hand-written entry always wins,
 * because it is already there. A word a learner has corrected is untouched. A
 * form the live Ekilex lookup has already cached is untouched. Running
 * this twice changes nothing the second time.
 *
 * `applyPosCorrections` is the one write here that is not an insert, and it
 * lives in this file rather than beside the seed because the reason for it is
 * the conflict key above. See its own comment for what it does; `seed.ts`
 * decides when, and the answer is earlier than this function.

 * anywhere. This repoints the existing row instead, which writes no content at

 * moves.
 *
 * Two guards, and both have a specific failure behind them rather than a
 * general caution. `editedBy IS NULL` is the shared-dictionary rule: a
 * correction one learner makes is everybody's, and a reseed walking over it
 * would erase a person's work along with the record of who did it. The `NOT
 * EXISTS` is the conflict key itself: `hall` is a noun meaning "frost" and an

 * that `--only-if-empty` takes, for the reason `ensureSearchIndexes` is there
 * too: a deploy does nothing to a dictionary that already has words, so
 * anything behind that check would never reach the deployments this is for.
 * It is also before the course harvest is written, and that ordering was
 * arrived at the hard way. Run afterwards, the harvest has already inserted
 * its own correct `kallis` ADJECTIVE, the `NOT EXISTS` guard correctly
 * declines to move the stale NOUN onto an occupied key, and the duplicate this
 * exists to prevent survives anyway.
 *
 * Idempotent, because after it runs the `from` row is gone and it matches
