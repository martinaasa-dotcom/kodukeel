 * Clears a note that is a copy of the Estonian definition beside it.

 * column of its own, and the live lookup wrote the Estonian into the English
 * one. So every word anybody had looked up on an existing deployment carries
 * that sentence in `notes`, and the entry would print it twice: once as the
 * definition and once under a heading saying "other meanings".
 *
 * IT RUNS ON BOTH PATHS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE OF WHY IT IS A FUNCTION. It was
 * written above the early return first, which is where a correction that has to
 * reach an already-seeded database belongs, and it was a deploy behind: the
 * definitions it compares against are written by the lines above it, so on the
 * first run it matched nothing and the duplicates showed until the next one.
 * Moving it below fixed that and broke the other half, because the rows it
 * targets exist only on a database somebody has been looking words up on, and
 * that is exactly the database `--only-if-empty` turns round and leaves. A
 * deployment reseeded by the workflow would keep printing the sentence twice
 * for ever. So the full run cleans up after what it just wrote, and the early
 * return cleans up on its way out, where the definitions were written by a
 * previous run and the comparison is just as valid.
 *
 * The rule is exactly the rows the old code made and no others. Where the two
 * columns hold the same sentence, the note is that copy. A real English note is
 * never equal to an Estonian definition, so nothing a person wrote and nothing
 * the builder stored can be caught by this.
