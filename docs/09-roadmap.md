# Implementation Roadmap

> **Where this stands.** Phases 0-5 shipped, plus a later pass that added the learning path, typed
> answers, the practice modes, XP/quests/progress and offline review (XP, the quests and the badges
> were later withdrawn as a second scoring system; ADR-014 amendment 1). `13-mvp-status.md` §6 is the
> current state; this file is kept as the plan the build actually followed. Two things it planned
> were later taken out as not being learning: the task list and class week of Phase 1, cut in
> `13-mvp-status.md` §24, where the reasoning is.

v4.0's four phases put two impossible iframes ahead of the SRS engine and bundled the riskiest work
into one overloaded phase with no de-risking. This roadmap front-loads the unknowns and orders the
rest by value delivered.

**Definition of done, every phase:** feature acceptance criteria met (`01-product-spec.md`), tests
written and passing, no TypeScript errors, no console errors, states from `08` §4 implemented,
keyboard-operable, and the phase demoed against a real study session.

## Phase 0: De-risk (2-3 days)

The phase v4.0 does not have, and the reason its plan would have failed in week three.

| Task | Output |
|---|---|
| **Request the Ekilex API key** | Submitted day one; human turnaround is not under our control and blocks Phase 2 |
| Spike: Ekilex API contract | A real response for `raamat`, `tuba`, `lugema`, `tulema` saved as fixtures; confirm the form data yields all five principal parts for both nouns and verbs |
| Spike: TartuNLP TTS | Fetch and play a `.wav` end to end; measure latency; confirm cache strategy |
| Scaffold | Next.js 15 + TS strict + Tailwind + shadcn + Prisma + Vitest + Playwright + CI |
| Seed fixture | ~500 A1-B1 lexemes committed, so all later work is unblocked if the key is delayed |

**Exit:** we know the Ekilex response shape from real data, audio plays, CI is green on an empty app.
**Gate:** if Ekilex data cannot supply all five noun principal parts, that is discovered here in
week one, with the plan intact, rather than in Phase 2 with a dictionary UI already built on the assumption.

---

## Phase 1: Shell, Today, Tasks (1 week)

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| App shell: sidebar, routing, theme, command palette | All eight routes exist, placeholders allowed |
| Prisma schema + first migration | Full schema from `04-data-model.md` |
| `lib/estonian/` domain core | Cases, principal parts, gradation, derivation: **100% unit tested**, no UI |
| Tasks CRUD with tags, week, due date, filtering | v4.0 Feature 1, complete |
| Today view | Due tasks, streak, empty states (no cards yet) |
| Diacritic input bar | Available everywhere from day one |

**Exit:** tasks are genuinely usable for the current class week. The domain core is tested and ready
for Phase 2 to consume.

> Building `lib/estonian/` in Phase 1 with no UI attached is deliberate. It is the hardest and
> highest-risk code in the project; it must not be written in a hurry behind a dictionary deadline.

---

## Phase 2: Dictionary + Anu (2 weeks)

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| Ekilex client, mapper, cache | Behind `/api/dictionary/*`; key server-side |
| Dictionary search + entry UI | Five principal parts, gradation badge, derived case table marked derived |
| TTS proxy + cache + player | TartuNLP, content-addressed, pre-warm on add |
| Anu chat, streaming, prompt caching | `06-anu-tutor.md` in full |
| Preset chips incl. object-case and gradation | Context-aware |
| Usage ledger + budget cap + cost meter | Before heavy use, not after the first bill |
| Anu eval suite | ~40 questions, run before prompt changes |

**Exit:** search `tuba`, see every form correct with gradation flagged, hear it, ask Anu why
`toa` loses the `b`, and get a correct explanation citing the pattern. Key absent from the client
bundle, verified in CI.

---

## Phase 3: Flashcards, imports, export (2 weeks)

The SRS moves ahead of Calendar because it is where the learning actually happens.

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| FSRS integration, card generation | `ts-fsrs`; the seven card types |
| Review session UI | Keyboard-first, audio, undo, session summary |
| `+ Add to Deck` everywhere | Dictionary, examples, Anu, selection |
| AI provenance badges + enrich flow | ADR-005 enforced in the UI |
| Generic paste importer | TSV/CSV/JSON/lines, preview, dedupe, Ekilex enrichment |
| **Export: JSON + Anki** | Ships here, not deferred |
| Today wired to due cards | The loop closes |

**Exit:** a full daily loop: Today shows due cards, review runs entirely from the keyboard offline,
new words arrive from dictionary/Anu/paste, and everything exports.

---

## Phase 4: Calendar, progress, voice spike (1.5 weeks)

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| iCal subscription + sync + per-feed errors | Read-only |
| Month/week calendar with tasks and review load | |
| Progress dashboard + **weak-case heatmap** | Click a weak case → filtered drill |
| **Spike: Estonian STT (2 days, timeboxed)** | Ships only if it works; otherwise the pronunciation self-check fallback |
| Speakly link-out + import preset | Honest scope (ADR-006) |

**Exit:** class schedule visible next to due work; the heatmap has changed a study decision.

---

## Phase 5: Durability and polish (1 week)

| Task | Notes |
|---|---|
| Offline: service worker, cached shell, queued writes | Review already works offline; this makes the shell match |
| Automated local backups + restore, tested | Restore is tested, or it is not a backup |
| FSRS parameter optimization from review history | Needs ~1 000 reviews |
| Performance pass | Search < 100 ms cached; review flip < 16 ms |
| Full a11y audit against `08` §5 | |
| Optional: Postgres/Supabase migration path | Only if remote access is wanted (see `12-open-questions.md`) |

---

## Summary and sequencing rationale

| Phase | Focus | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | De-risk + scaffold | 2-3 days |
| 1 | Shell, Today, Tasks, domain core | 1 week |
| 2 | Dictionary + Anu | 2 weeks |
| 3 | Flashcards + imports + export | 2 weeks |
| 4 | Calendar + progress + voice spike | 1.5 weeks |
| 5 | Offline, backup, tuning, a11y | 1 week |
| | **Total** | **≈ 8 weeks** |

Three ordering decisions worth stating:

1. **Unknowns first.** Everything that depends on someone else's server is probed in Phase 0, when a
   surprise costs a day instead of a phase.
2. **The domain core before anything renders it.** The hardest code is written and tested in
   isolation, not under UI deadline pressure.
3. **The SRS before the calendar.** v4.0 had it the other way round. The calendar is convenience; the
   SRS is the product.

Each phase is independently useful. Stopping after Phase 3 still leaves a genuinely valuable tool.
