# UX, Information Architecture and Accessibility

v4.0 specified "sidebar navigation with tabs" and nothing else: no default view, no keyboard model,
no empty states, no accessibility, and no answer to the daily friction of typing `õäöü` on a US
keyboard.

## 1. Information architecture

```
Sidebar
├── Today          ← default route
├── Tasks
├── Dictionary
├── Anu            (tutor)
├── Flashcards
├── Calendar
├── Imports
└── Progress
                   Settings (bottom)
```

**Today is the default route**, not Tasks. This is the fix for audit gap D2: a dashboard whose front
door is a list of tabs makes the user decide what to do before they have done anything. Today answers
"what now": due cards, due tasks, next class, one button to start.

## 2. Cross-cutting interactions

**`+ Add to Deck` is everywhere.** Dictionary entry, individual example, Anu message, import row,
selected text. Same component, same confirmation, provenance recorded. This is the interaction that
makes the dashboard more than six tabs in a trench coat.

**Command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl-K`).** Search a word, jump to a tab, start a review, add a task, ask
Anu. For a power tool used daily by one person, the palette is faster than any navigation.

**Global keyboard map:**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd/Ctrl-K` | Command palette |
| `g` then `t` / `d` / `a` / `f` / `c` | Go to Tasks / Dictionary / Anu / Flashcards / Calendar |
| `/` | Focus search |
| `n` | New task (context-dependent) |
| `?` | Keyboard shortcut help |

Review-session keys are in `07-srs.md` §3. Undo (`u`) is specified there but is not in
the MVP. See `13-mvp-status.md` §4.

## 3. Estonian text input (audit C9)

A daily friction point v4.0 does not mention. Typing `õ ä ö ü š ž` on a US layout is slow, and a
learner will avoid features that require it.

Three affordances, all of them:

1. **A letter bar** under every Estonian text input: `õ ä ö ü š ž` as click-to-insert buttons.
   On a computer only, and only for somebody who wants it. A phone keyboard already has these
   letters and the row costs it the scarce thing; an Estonian keyboard has them as keys and the row
   is a line of buttons that will never be pressed. Asked on the first screen of first run,
   reversible from Settings and from the row itself. See `lib/ux/letterBar.ts`.
2. **Long-press / repeat-key expansion**: pressing `o` twice quickly inserts `õ`. Configurable,
   off by default.
3. **Diacritic-insensitive search**: typing `sona` finds `sõna`; `raamat` matches regardless.
   Implemented as a normalised search column so it is a real index lookup, not a scan.

Answer checking in review is **diacritic-strict by default**: `sona` is not `sõna` and accepting it
teaches the wrong spelling, with a "close, check the diacritics" hint rather than a bare wrong mark.

## 4. States

Every view specifies four states. v4.0 specified none (audit C6).

| View | Empty | Loading | Error | Offline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Today | "Nothing due. Add words or review ahead" + actions | Skeleton tiles | Section-level, others render | Fully functional |
| Dictionary | Search prompt + recent searches | Skeleton entry | "Ekilex unavailable, showing cached" | Cached entries open |
| Flashcards | "No cards yet" + import/dictionary links | Instant (local) | n/a | Fully functional |
| Anu | Persona intro + chips | Streaming cursor | Typed error + retry, message preserved | "Anu needs a connection" |
| Calendar | "Add a feed" | Skeleton grid | Per-feed error row | Cached events |
| Imports | Paste area with format examples | Parse progress | Row-level errors, partial import allowed | Works, parsing is local |

### 4a. The screen a round opens on

A round is a fifth thing, and it is not a state: before any of it is drawn, a
screen says what will be on the screen and what the learner does about it, and
they press through it. `lib/copy/briefings.ts` is the copy and the argument;
`components/round/Briefing.tsx` is the drawing.

Two sentences, because they answer different questions. What will be there (the
pictures, the clock, the box) and what to do with it. The count of cards is
handed in by the page rather than written into the copy, because how many are
due tonight is a fact about one deck.

It is wired at the **page**, with the round as a child, so the round is not
mounted while the briefing is up: no clock has started and no clip has played
behind the screen somebody is reading. The page is also what knows whether
there is a round at all, so a view with nothing to do reaches its own empty
state above and draws no briefing.

Five rounds opened on a start screen of their own before this existed and keep
it, reading the same two sentences so the wording is one table's. Four screens
are exempt in `lib/copy/briefingCoverage.ts`, every one of them a screen that
already opens on a briefing of its own, and a sweep over the filesystem fails
on a round that opens cold.

## 5. Accessibility (audit C8)

Target **WCAG 2.2 AA**. Not aspiration. This app is used for an hour a day.

- **Full keyboard operation.** Every action reachable without a mouse; visible focus rings; logical
  tab order; no keyboard traps.
- **Screen reader.** Semantic landmarks, labelled controls, `aria-live="polite"` on streaming tutor
  responses and on review grading feedback.
- **Contrast** ≥ 4.5:1 for text, ≥ 3:1 for UI boundaries, verified in both themes.
- **Never colour alone.** Card difficulty, provenance badges and gradation types all carry an icon
  or text label as well as a colour.
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** respected, so card flip animations become instant.
- **Text scaling** to 200% without loss of function.
- **Audio never required.** Listening cards always offer a text alternative, and when the TTS
  proxy cannot produce any, Listening and Dictation say so and show the word rather than leaving a
  silent exercise with no question in it.
- **Shortcuts are documented, not folklore.** `?` anywhere opens the shortcut sheet
  (`components/Shortcuts.tsx`), which lists every binding the app actually implements. It stays out
  of the way while a field has focus, because `?` is a character before it is a command. Nothing is
  keyboard-only: the sheet is a shortcut to what the tab order already reaches.

## 6. Visual design

> Superseded in detail by `14-design-system.md` (2026-08). The principles below still hold; the
> palette, type and shape they are implemented with now live there.

- Light and dark themes, following the OS by default.
- One accent colour; grammatical case colour-coding is **consistent app-wide**: the same case is the
  same colour in the dictionary table, the heatmap and the flashcards. Learners build spatial memory
  off this, so it must never drift between views.
- Estonian text in a font with proper `õ ä ö ü` rendering; forms in a slightly larger size than UI
  chrome, since they are the content.
- Density: comfortable in Dictionary and Anu, compact in Tasks and Progress.

## 7. Responsive

Desktop-first: the stated use case is a laptop at a desk. But:

- Sidebar collapses to a bottom bar under 768 px.
- **Review must be fully usable on a phone**, with large tap targets replacing the number keys. Ten
  minutes of reviews on a bus is a real use case even when authoring is not.
- Dictionary tables scroll horizontally inside their own container; the page body never scrolls
  sideways.
