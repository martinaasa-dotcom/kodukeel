# Design System: "rukkilill sunrise"

The visual language the app was rebuilt on in 2026-08. It replaces the birch-and-cornflower
neutral scheme described in `08-ux-ia-a11y.md` §6; everything that document says about
*behavior* (the four states, the keyboard model, the diacritic bar) still holds.

## 1. Why it looks like this

The app is opened by one person, alone, most days, usually tired, usually in the evening. Two
things follow from that:

**It has to be warm before it is impressive.** A grammar drill that looks like a tax form is a
drill you stop opening. So: pastels, round corners, a mascot, and a small physical response to
every press.

**Color has to mean something.** Warmth costs nothing until colour stops carrying information.
So the palette is disciplined: a mostly-white ground, five hues with fixed meanings, and a wash
of pastel light behind everything so the ground never reads as grey.

| Hue | Token | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Cornflower / violet | `--accent` | the app's voice, the primary action, "this is yours" |
| Mint | `--mint` / `--good` | recalled, goal met, known |
| Butter | `--butter` / `--hard` | nearly, timed, a warning that isn't a failure |
| Peach | `--peach` / `--again` | missed, overdue, destructive |
| Sky | `--sky` / `--easy` | easy, new, reference material |
| Blush | `--blush` | Anu, the tutor, the one part of the app that talks back |

Grading colors are aliases (`--again` → `--peach`), so the rating scale and the rest of the UI
can never drift apart.

Two uses of colour, and only one of them carries meaning:

- **A chip's hue is a claim.** `again` on a chip says "this is not authoritative", and it is what
  every AI-written translation wears, in the dictionary, in Anu's replies, on the grammar pages
  and in dictation. `hard` says "there is an irregularity here to learn", which is what gradation
  notes and the memorized principal parts wear. Reach for a hue on a chip only when you mean the
  thing that hue means.
- **A tile in a set of tiles is just telling itself apart from its neighbors.** The four figures
  in a session summary, and the practice modes on Today, cycle the palette so they can be scanned
  apart. XP is blush there because it is the fifth tile, not because Anu is involved.

### Every hue has an ink

The five hues are chosen to read as *colour* at full strength: a bar, a ring, a
dot, a filled button. Set as **text on their own 8% tint** they land around
2.5:1, which is decoration pretending to be a label. So each hue also has an
ink: the same colour walked down until it clears 4.5:1 on its own tint.

| Use | Token |
|---|---|
| A bar, ring, dot, or filled surface | `--mint`, `--peach`, `--butter`, `--sky`, `--blush`, `--accent` |
| Text or a meaningful icon on that hue's tint | `--mint-ink`, `--peach-ink`, `--butter-ink`, `--sky-ink`, `--blush-ink`, **`--accent-deep`** |
| Text on the *solid* accent | `--accent-ink` (white) |
| Text on the *solid* mint | `--on-mint` (near-black, the same in both themes) |

Mint is the other half of that trap and did not have its own answer until a
contrast pass found the hole: the tick inside a reviewed day on Today's week
strip was `--surface`, which is white on `#1fb894` at 2.52:1. `--mint-ink` is
the ink on mint's *tint* and is no use on the solid fill, so `--on-mint` is the
one for that, and it is a single value in both themes rather than a light and a
dark, because both mints are light enough for it: 7.40:1 on `#1fb894` and
11.70:1 on the dark theme's `#5fe3bc`. It is written out rather than
`var(--ink)`, which inverts with the theme and would take the tick with it.

The accent is the trap: `--accent-ink` was already the white that sits on the
solid button, so the accent's *tint* ink is `--accent-deep`. Anything building a
token name from a tone must go through `toneInk()` in `components/ui.tsx`, or it
paints white text on a pale lilac tile.

The grading aliases follow: `--good-ink`, `--hard-ink`, `--again-ink`,
`--easy-ink`. In dark mode each ink is the hue itself, since the dark tints are deep
enough that the hue already clears 7:1 on them.

`--ink-3` is picked against every surface in the system rather than against
white: 5.26:1 on the softest tint and better everywhere else, so a caption stays
legible on a pastel tile.

It was two steps lighter than that, and the correction came from the one thing
"every surface" did not cover. The navigation rail is drawn over `.wash`, a
blurred pastel blob rather than a named background, so the wordmark's subtitle
and the rail's own controls sat at 4.36 on every signed-in screen. The wash is
a surface too, whatever the token list says.

**And a fade is never applied to a box that holds words.** `opacity` on a
container multiplies through everything inside it, which is how a locked unit
on the course page ended up explaining itself at 2.63:1: the sentence saying
"you can still open it" was the least readable thing on that screen, on every
locked row of a 73-unit course. The badge shelf and the grammar reference had
the same shape. A state that means "not yet" has a border, an icon and a
sentence to say so with; where a fade genuinely helps, it goes on the icon,
which carries no words.

Both gradients are pinned to contrast too. `.grad-accent` carries white text, so
every stop clears 4.5:1 against white; `.grad-text` *is* the text, so every stop
clears 4.5:1 against the page. The previous ramp ran 4.05 → 3.46 → 3.50, which
made the app's most-pressed button its least legible surface.

`.grad-accent` also runs *horizontally*, at 90deg. A tilted ramp reaches a
different point at the top and the bottom of a fully round cap, so on a pill it
leaves a fleck of the far end's hue at the near end: at 112deg the primary
button carried a little pink on its left edge and a little blue on its right.
The vertical spread is set by the element's height, so no angle short of
horizontal avoids it on something short and wide. `.grad-text` keeps its tilt,
being clipped to letterforms that have no caps to discolour.

### A verdict is painted once

Correct is green and wrong is red, and the table above has said so since the palette was drawn.
What decides whether a screen honors it is not the table but who reaches for the tokens, and
twenty screens reaching for them by hand produced four verdicts written in the fill, one round
that never marked the option the learner pressed, and a near miss painted the same peach as a
blank. `lib/ux/verdict.ts` is the vocabulary and `app/globals.css` is the paint:

| Word | Class | Paint |
|---|---|---|
| right | `.verdict-right` | `--good-soft` under `--good-ink` |
| nearly | `.verdict-nearly` | `--hard-soft` under `--hard-ink` |
| wrong | `.verdict-wrong` | `--again-soft` under `--again-ink` |
| the answer, among options | `.option-right` | the tint and the ink, and an edge in `--good` |
| what was pressed instead | `.option-wrong` | the tint and the ink, and a thin edge in `--again` |
| the rest | `.option-other` | `--raised` under `--ink-3` |

A panel, a chip, a self-grade button or a marked word wears one of the first three; an option
once the answer is known wears one of the last three, whichever the learner pressed. The
classes read the grading aliases and never the hue names, so `--again` and a wrong answer are
one token. A screen that marks an answer reads the module or fails the invariant, and a verdict
tint written inline in one of those screens fails it too. Nearly is the middle case the app can
tell apart with certainty, a dropped diacritic or the right word in the wrong ending, and it is
graded Hard wherever it is painted butter, since a colour that disagrees with the grade under it
is a small dishonesty a learner catches once.

And the box is `.verdict-panel`, which is the other half of the same argument. The three classes
above settled the colour and nothing else, so every round decided the geometry and the type for
itself: five wrote `rounded-md px-3.5 py-3` around a `text-[15px]`, the daily path and the ladder
wrote `text-sm`, the lesson wrote `p-3 text-sm`, the word ordering round set a whole sentence in
`label-xs`, and the examination result printed the answer at 17px beside the candidate's own at
13.5px. Four sizes for one object, three of them under the body step and two off the scale. A
learner reported the ladder's box as tiny and off-putting under a prompt set at 27px, which is
what 13.5px on a panel reads as.

The panel is `--r-sm`, 12px by 14px of padding and `--text-md`, and a verdict is never set below
the body step anywhere: it is the one line that says whether the last half minute went anywhere.
It sat at `--text-base` for a commit and was reported as still small, which is the reading to
trust, since the body step is right for a paragraph a reader is already inside and this is one
line under a prompt set at 27px. A caption genuinely inside a panel, the provenance under a
sentence or the "you typed" line under a marked word, still takes its own step, so the rule is
drawn on the element wearing the tint rather than on everything under it.

## 2. Tokens

Defined twice in `app/globals.css`, deliberately:

- in `@theme`, so Tailwind utilities (`bg-mint`, `text-ink-2`) exist;
- in `:root`, so the inline `style` props the views use can read them.

The `:root` copy is the one that flips for dark mode, and there are two states rather than
three: the default (bare `:root`, which is light for everybody) and chosen dark
(`:root[data-theme="dark"]`, written by the toggle in the rail and read back before first paint
by the inline script in `app/layout.tsx`). The system's own preference is deliberately not
read. It used to be, and it meant the landing page opened dark for about half its visitors
while being designed and measured in the light; a theme is either the default or the one
somebody picked, and `scripts/test-invariants.ts` fails on a `prefers-color-scheme` palette
coming back.

Shape: `--r-sm` 10px, `--r` 16px, `--r-lg` 22px, `--r-xl` 30px. Buttons, chips and pills are
fully round. Tailwind's own radius names are remapped onto those four in `@theme`, so a stray
`rounded-md` lands on 10px instead of inventing a 6px corner. The single exception is the heatmap
cell: at 10px square, a token radius rounds it into a dot and the grid stops reading as a calendar.

Shadows are violet-tinted rather than grey (`--shadow-sm/-/-lg`), plus `--shadow-accent` for the
one gradient button.

## 3. Type

**One face, Plus Jakarta Sans.** Estonian used to be set in Fraunces, a second face carrying
headings and the numbers a screen is about as well. It meant two typefaces inside one card
wherever a prompt and its answers are in different languages, which is most of this app: a
lesson step asks "Which word is this?" in the interface face and offers four Estonian answers
in the other one, and the next step asks the same question the other way round and swaps them
over. Weight and size are what a heading is told apart by now, which is what they were already
doing on every screen that had no Estonian on it.

**Twelve steps, and nothing between them.** The app previously used twenty-eight distinct sizes,
13px and 13.5px and 14px appearing inside one card, each chosen once and never compared with the
others. A reader does not see half a pixel; they see a page that will not settle.

| Step | px | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `text-2xs` | 14 | micro-label: uppercase, tracked, sparingly. **The floor** |
| `text-xs` | 15 | captions, meta, provenance |
| `text-sm` | 16 | secondary body, dense UI |
| `text-base` | 17 | body |
| `text-md` | 19 | lead paragraphs, card titles |
| `text-lg` | 21 | section headings |
| `text-xl` | 24 | card headline |
| `text-2xl` | 27 | the number a screen is about |
| `text-3xl` | 32 | page title |
| `text-4xl` | 40 | display |
| `text-5xl` / `6xl` / `7xl` | 52 / 68 / 88 | landing hero |

**The floor is 14 and it was 12, because 12 was drawn for the wrong reader.** It was argued for as
the smallest an uppercase label can be on a phone held at arm's length in the evening, which is a
claim about a screen rather than about whoever is holding it. Most people learning Estonian in
Estonia are learning it because they live here, which takes in everybody who arrived forty years
ago: the reader is as likely to be sixty and wearing glasses as to be twenty-five. It was reported
in those words, as small fonts that are horrible to read, off a review card whose caption line was
13px grey.

So the bottom four steps went 12/13/13.5/15 to 14/15/16/17, which is a body above the 16px most of
the web settles on and a floor a pixel over what a browser will render comfortably at arm's length.
They ramp a pixel at a time rather than keeping the old proportions, and that is the deliberate
part: a caption has to read as quieter than the body above it, and once the floor is somewhere a
reader can see, quieter is carried by colour and weight far more than by two more pixels off
something already small. `--ink-3` against `--ink` is a bigger difference than 15px against 17px
and always was.

**The display steps did not move.** 32px was never the complaint, and growing the top of the scale
costs containment on a phone for no legibility anybody asked for: `text-3xl` is the Estonian word
on a review card, which is a long word in a 360px column. The hero is measured against the width
and the height of the window it has to fit in, below, so moving it would break a fit that was
measured rather than chosen.

**A size is a step's name, never a number.** That is what makes the table above the only place the
app's type size is decided, and it is asserted (`test-invariants.ts`, "no type size is written as a
literal"). The rule used to be the weaker one, that a literal had to *land* on a step, and the cost
of the difference was 127 elements across 25 files: `text-[13.5px]` is an honest size, it is not a
token, and when the scale was raised every one of them would have stayed where it was. They were on
the lesson, the mastery board, the readiness rows and every review round, which is to say on the
screens a learner spends the evening in. Both doors are swept, since an inline `fontSize` sets a
size as firmly as a class does; four files are exempt by name, two OG images Satori renders without
this stylesheet, an emoji scaled to its card, and the root error boundary, which runs when
`globals.css` may never have loaded. An `em` is not a literal and is allowed: it is a proportion of
the step the text already sits on, so it moves with the scale, which is the property the rule
exists to protect.

**The twelfth is the landing hero and nothing else.** 68px was the top of the scale and it was
too small for the job: filling the window with the hero and centering the
column in it left a 363px block of copy inside an 877px box, which reads as a postage stamp in a
field rather than as a page with room to breathe. Air is generous around something with the
weight to deserve it. So the display steps once more, the paragraph under it goes from 17 to 19,
and the block comes out about two thirds of the window instead of a third.

88px is taken on **width and height together**, at 768 and 740, which is the part a breakpoint
alone gets wrong. The width is what the longest line needs, since "Estonian that" is 536px at
this size against the 704px the column has at 768; gating it at `lg` instead left a portrait
tablet with 216px of air over a headline two steps too small for it. The height is what the
column needs: 88px over a 19px paragraph is about 490px of copy, and a 1024x600 laptop has 397px
to put it in, so the hero would push the next section clean off the first screen.
Measured at the boundary: 740 leaves 64px over the headline, 739 falls back to 68px.

**The hero is as tall as what is in it, and the page has one gap.** It used to fill the window
less the nav and a peek band, and the leftover air under the column plus the next section's own
padding was 230px of nothing on a 900px window while every other pair of sections stood 160
apart. `--section-gap` on `.landing` is the one distance now, 88px on a phone and 136px from
`md`: `main` is a column with that gap, no section carries vertical padding, and the footer
stands the same distance off the close. `test-design.mjs` measures every seam against it.

`.label-xs` sits on the floor, uppercase and tracked, which is what a marker can afford to be and
a sentence cannot. Nothing is off the scale: the one thing that used to be, the step numeral behind
the landing page's how-it-works cards, went when that page was shortened, and the next ornament
that earns an exception gets it named and argued for rather than parked on a literal.

It is loaded with `latin-ext`, which is not optional: without it `õ ä ö ü š ž` fall back to a
different face mid-word, which is the fault this rule exists to prevent. The font variable is
attached to `<html>`, not `<body>`, because `--font-sans` is declared on `:root` and references
it, and a custom property is substituted where it is declared, so the face has to be in scope
there.

### Text stays in its box

Four declarations in `app/globals.css`, and between them they are the reason no screen here has a
word sitting on the ground behind a card.

- **`overflow-wrap: anywhere`, inherited from the body.** A word that will not fit breaks.
  `anywhere` rather than `break-word` because only `anywhere` counts toward min-content, which is
  what a flex or grid item's automatic minimum is: with `break-word` one long word is a floor under
  the whole row and the row leaves the card having broken nothing. Estonian is why this is not
  academic. The dictionary holds compounds past twenty characters and the row holding one is three
  or four columns wide on a phone.
- **`table { overflow-wrap: break-word }` is the single exemption.** A table of forms is read by
  comparing them down a column, so a form split across two lines has to be reassembled before it
  can be compared. The table pays for that with a scroller of its own, which every table in the app
  sits in and `scripts/test-invariants.ts` checks.
- **`svg.lucide { flex: none }`.** An icon is a square and a flex item with no `flex` of its own
  both shrinks and grows: measured with the rule off, `lucide-eye-off` was drawn 0x15 in a deck row
  and `lucide-sun` 28x16 in the rail. `shrink-0` was on about a fifth of the icons in the app,
  which is what a rule kept by remembering looks like from the inside.
- **`img, video, canvas, iframe, input, select, textarea { max-width: 100% }`.** The one thing
  wrapping cannot reach: a replaced element brings its own width. Settings' backup picker is an
  `<input type="file">`, laid out at 336px from its button label and room for a filename, and it
  was in a 278px card on a 360px phone.

`scripts/test-containment.mjs` is the half that measures rectangles: every text-bearing element,
every icon and everything with a width of its own, across every route the app has at 360, 768 and
1280, in the dark as well as the light, in the states a route does not arrive in, and on the three
screens that need a row made before they can be visited. Four questions each time, of which the
fourth is whether anything is drawn on top of anything else. Then the same four again with every
run of text swapped for one of the same length with no space or hyphen in it. Same length is the
discipline: a stress test that hands every element a forty-character word is unfalsifiable, since a
ring whose middle says "42%" fails it and no markup would pass. Same length asks what the language
actually asks.

768 earns its place: it is the width at which the rail appears, so the content column is narrower
there than at any other width the app is used at, and every fault this suite has found since it
started measuring three widths has been at that one.

## 4. Motion

Small, physical, and never blocking:

- `.lift`: cards that are themselves a link rise 3px on hover.
- `.press`: every button dips on `:active`. This is most of what makes the app feel responsive.
- `.transition-ui`: the shared transition, with its properties named. Never `transition-all`:
  that animates `outline-width` too, so a focus ring fades in over 200ms and a keyboard user
  watches it arrive.
- `.fade-up`, `.pop-in`: entrances for content that has just arrived (a flipped card, a summary).
- `.float`: the mascot's bob, six seconds up and down.
- `.drift` and `.letter-lean`: the four letters tucked over the sides of the landing page's case
  explorer, and nowhere else. They belong to that card because its contents are the letters
  themselves; one drifting in the margin beside a headline is a decoration that has come loose.
  Four characters rather than one wander, declared in `lib/ux/letterMotion.ts` and drawn by
  `components/LetterTile.tsx`: one ambles, one crouches and springs, one hangs and swings, one
  rolls. No two share a period, so a set of them falls back into step about once an hour.
  **The travel goes along the edge a letter hangs off, not across it.** A letter tucked over the
  top of a card has about four pixels before it is sitting on a word and most of the card's width
  sideways, so the one that used to wander six pixels toward the card now slides about forty
  along it and crosses the edge by one. What the small budget buys instead is the rock and the
  squash, and `room` scales both per placement: a rotated square is wider than its side, so eight
  degrees on the tightest letter costs more than fifteen on the one with a gutter under it.
  **And it has to be quick enough to catch.** At 26 to 30px over periods of up to seven seconds
  the four were measured moving and reported as still, which is the same fault as the six pixels
  in a different unit: nobody sees a square cross a hand's width in six seconds unless they are
  already watching it. The periods are 2.9 to 5.3 seconds now, the rock and the squash a third
  bigger, and the travel 38 to 44px.
  **They hop when the word changes.** The explorer says so on `document` (`LETTER_CHEER_EVENT`)
  and each tile hops once, in the order they were placed, as `scale` and `rotate` on the wrapper
  so the wander underneath is never restarted. It is the one thing the four do as a set, and it
  happens only when something on the card happened.
  **They answer a pointer.** Coming near one slides it toward the cursor along that same free axis
  and settles it further onto the card, which is `leanFor()` and is the same rule as the wander:
  either way along the edge, inward only across it. They stay `pointer-events-none`, so none of it
  reaches a control underneath.
  The slant itself is a `rotate` property rather than a keyframe, so it survives
  `prefers-reduced-motion` turning every animation here into 0.01ms; the wander rocks it around
  that declared value, and the lean is `transform` on a wrapper, which is the one property left.
  `scripts/test-design.mjs` steps each letter through twelve frames of its own cycle at three
  widths, because the amplitude that makes this pleasant is a few pixels from the one that lifts a
  letter off the card or drops it on the button.
- `.letter-key`: the six keys that type õ, ä, ö, ü, š and ž. The one place a letter is a control
  rather than an ornament, so it grows under a pointer and shakes once on the way in. `.press`
  still supplies the dip, so a key is one control with one set of states.
- The case explorer walks itself once, a word every few seconds while it is on screen and
  untouched, and stops the moment anybody presses, types or focuses inside it; not at all under
  reduced motion. Under a pointer its stem row and its endings point at each other through
  `:has()`, and the word chips grow and shake like the app's own letter keys.
- `.word-in.grad-sweep`: the headline's last word arrives, is pressed onto the page once like a
  sticker (`word-stick`, `scale` alone), and then its gradient pans. The two classes each set
  `animation` and the pan had never run.
- `.reveal`: the landing page's scroll-driven section reveal, done with CSS scroll timelines so
  no content is ever hidden behind a script; browsers without them get the finished state.
- The navigation's marker (`app/nav.css`, `lib/ux/navMotion.ts`): one pane that says where you are,
  down the rail and across the phone bar, and a second fainter one that says what you are reaching
  for. Borrowed from Upside Lab's dock with its measurements intact.
  **Whether the marker travels is a question about the input.** A thumb has nothing else to do while
  a server answers, so the phone bar's pill slides from the cell you left to the cell you asked for.
  A pointer has already arrived and its own pane has been following it down the column all along,
  so the rail's marker does not travel at all: it is written straight to its resting geometry and is
  simply there on the row you pressed. On the bar, where it does travel, its leading edge sets off
  before its trailing edge follows, so it stretches across the ground it covers and gathers itself
  up on arrival, by a distance rather than by a fixed keyframe: one cell of the phone bar is 1.40x,
  measured. That runs as a transform animation handed to the compositor,
  never a transition on `top` or `left`, because those are laid out and painted on the main thread
  and the main thread is exactly what a page navigation is busy with. And it leaves on the press
  rather than on the page, since these pages are rendered on a server and the wait is real; a press
  dragged off, a page that answers somewhere else, or four seconds of nothing all call the bet off,
  while a click on the cell ends the betting, since calling a bet off mid-navigation puts the pill
  back on the row you are leaving and then sends it out again. A bet that loses arrives rather than
  travels: reverting is a correction and not a journey.
  **Reaching and arriving are one object at two weights.** The pointer's pane was a second material
  once, the accent's softest tint reaching 3px past the row with the words in the accent's ink, and
  that made the two states of one row two different objects: a lavender pill where you were
  pointing, a white card where you had clicked, and on the row you were already on the tint stuck
  out round the card as a second outline. Both panes read one fill now, `--nav-marker-bg`, and the
  marker's own `--nav-marker-shadow` is the whole difference, so pointing at a row previews pressing
  it. What tells them apart is what a pane cannot say: the marked row is bold and its glyph wears
  its own colour.
  The phone bar's capsule also breathes, three percent uniformly on both axes over 460ms with a
  slight undershoot; the rail does not, because a column that lurched beside the page it just
  changed would be arguing with a decision the reader has already made.

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` flattens all of it, and switches `.reveal` off outright, because a
scroll-driven animation has no duration to shorten, so it needs removing rather than shrinking.

## 5. Components

`components/ui.tsx` holds the primitives: `Page`, `Card` (with pastel `tone`s), `SectionTitle`,
`Chip`, `Empty`, `Stat`, `StatTile`, `Ring`, `Meter`, `Note`, `Skeleton`, `Wash`. `components/Button.tsx` has one gradient
variant (`primary`) and four quiet ones; one loud action per screen.

`components/Choice.tsx` is the one answer to "pick one of these" and "pick any of these":
`ChoiceGroup` plus `ChoiceChip` (a pill) or `ChoiceCard` (an answer with a line under it). It
exists because there was no primitive for it and every screen that asked invented one, two of the
three wrongly. The worst was a bare `<button>` wrapped round a `<Chip>`: a chip is the app's
*label*, so the control had no border, no shadow and no hover, and eight of them under a heading
read as a legend rather than as a form. Chosen was `--raised` swapped for `--accent-soft`, two
percent of lightness apart on the dark theme, which is a distinction carried by hue alone on the
one screen where the distinction *is* the answer. And every option carried `aria-pressed`, so a
set of mutually exclusive answers announced as that many unrelated switches and cost that many
tab stops.

Three things follow, and each has an invariant:

- **A group knows what kind of question it is.** `select="one"` is a real radio group: one tab
  stop, arrow keys between the options, "3 of 8". `select="many"` is toggle buttons, which is
  what `aria-pressed` actually means. The roving tab stop is settled from the DOM, because only
  the group knows whether *any* option is chosen and first run always starts with none.
- **Chosen inverts rather than tints, on a pill.** A luminance change survives both themes and
  anybody who cannot separate the two hues. A card keeps the tint, because its second line is
  `--ink-3` and a solid fill would swallow it, so it doubles its rule and shows a tick instead.
- **The states are CSS, not a `style` prop.** `.choice-btn` plus the two `[data-on]` rules in
  `globals.css`. An inline style beats a stylesheet, so a component that paints its resting
  background inline can never define a hover. That is the mechanism that made the missing hover
  unfixable in place, rather than a detail, and it is why `.choice-btn` is shared with the
  multiple-choice answers rather than copied: two sessions found the same cause the same day, and
  main's fix reached it through a custom property, which is the more precise of the two.

**A hover makes a control more present, never less.** `.choice-btn` (a bordered box: its tone comes
in through `--choice-border`/`--choice-bg` so the hover can actually win) and `.tap-tint` (a bare
row or icon button: a raised tint arrives under the pointer) replaced
`transition-opacity hover:opacity-80` on twenty-odd controls. Fading a
thing under the cursor is the one hover the rest of this interface uses for nothing else, because
dimming is exactly how every disabled control here is drawn: the strongest signal a mouse got on
those screens was the control appearing to switch off. A link may still fade, and a `<button>`
drawn as underlined text is a link wearing the right element.

**A text box has one shape, in two sizes, and the keys under it stand one distance off.** `.field`
is a form's field, at `--r` and 10px by 14px; `.field-lg` is the answer box a round leads with, a
search box, an exam paper and the shared `EstonianInput`, at `--r-lg` and 14px by 20px. There were
nine shapes before them, on three radii and with paddings from px-2.5 to px-5, so the caret sat a
different distance in from the edge on every screen that asked for a word and two boxes on one form
did not match each other. Type size and colour stay with the caller: a box in a card sits on
`--raised` and one on a page on `--surface`, and that is a fact about the surface under it. A
learner said the row of Estonian keys felt glued to the box above it, and it was: 8px, which is the
rhythm between rows in a list, under a row of 36px circles. `--field-gap` is 14px, the same as the
field's own inner padding, and `.under-field` is how a caller asks for it, on the wrapper rather
than the bar, because the bar also stands beside a button and under a crossword clue where there is
no field edge. The invariant reads every input and textarea in the tree, so a tenth shape cannot
arrive by hand, and fails on a bar under a field that types its own margin.

`components/brand.tsx` holds **Õ**, the mascot: Estonian's most recognizable letter is already a
round face with a squiggle on top, so the mascot is that letter taken literally. It appears in
the rail, in every empty state, at the end of a session, and on the landing page. It is a
component rather than an asset so it inherits the theme and can change mood.

## 6. Routing and the landing page

Two route groups:

- `app/(app)/`: the signed-in shell, with rail, floating mobile bar, pastel wash.
- `app/(chromeless)/`: `/welcome`, `/sign-in` and `/start` (first-run setup), which own the
  whole screen and get none of that chrome. Being in this group is what decides it: the rail is
  rendered by `(app)/layout.tsx` and never has a path list to keep in sync.

`/welcome` is public (see `middleware.ts`) and is the front door for a signed-out visitor
arriving at `/`. Every Estonian form on it is read from the real dictionary and run through
`buildCaseTable()`, the same function the app uses. Nothing on that page is a mock-up, and no
Estonian form on it was typed into marketing copy by hand. If the database is unreachable it
falls back to principal parts copied verbatim from the checked seed set, and shows no derived
forms at all.

## 7. What has not changed

- Every view still implements the four states from `08-ux-ia-a11y.md` §4.
- Every interactive element is still keyboard-reachable, with a visible focus ring, now 2.5px,
  offset 3px.
- Estonian text still carries `lang="et"`, and every Estonian input still has the letter bar,
  on a desktop and for a learner who has not turned it off.
- No Estonian morphology is generated anywhere, including in decoration.

## 8. Session screens

Every practice mode (review, sprint, match, listening, sentences, speaking, dictation) wears the
same chrome, because they are the same activity seen from different angles and a learner should not
have to re-learn the frame:

- a top row of **close · progress · counter**: an `X` back to Today in a round hover target, a
  gradient-filled progress bar with `role="progressbar"`, and the number left in an accent pill;
- one **card** at `--r-xl` with `--shadow-lg`, split into a labelled header strip, the question
  area (`aria-live="polite"`), and a footer holding the only action;
- a **summary** on the way out: the mascot cheering, then `StatTile`s, then the two or three
  places worth going next.

The three bands of that card share one inset, 24px, and they did not: the header sat at 20, the body
at 24 and the footer at 16, so the one action started eight pixels left of the answer box it
belonged to. Every seam a round draws is `px-6` now and an invariant reads the seams off the rounds
rather than off a list of them.

Nothing about that is decoration. The counter is what stops a session feeling endless, the single
footer action is what makes the next keystroke obvious, and the summary is where an achievement
toast has somewhere to land.

## 9. Screens brought into the system

The pastel rebuild and the teaching-in-context pass (`13-mvp-status.md` §7) were built in
parallel and merged. The screens that arrived from the second of those (classes, the sentence
builder, speaking, the tables of forms, example sentences, the install prompt) were restyled
onto the primitives above rather than kept as they were: token radii instead of hand-rolled ones,
`Card` tones instead of bordered boxes, `StatTile` summaries, and `press`/`lift` on anything that
can be clicked.

One rule came out of that merge and is worth keeping: **a flex or grid item that holds text needs
`min-w-0`**. Without it the item refuses to shrink below its own content, and a single long task
title widens the whole page on a phone. The mobile sweep in `scripts/` checks for exactly this,
no horizontal overflow at 390px on any route.

## 10. Paper

`@media print` lives in `app/globals.css`, not on the one page that prints, because it is true of
every page: the rail, the mobile bar, the pastel wash and anything marked `no-print` come off, and
`page-break` starts a new sheet. A worksheet printed with a navigation rail down the side is not a
worksheet.

Two classes are the whole contract: `no-print` on screen-only controls, `page-break` where a new
sheet begins. `avoid-break` keeps an exercise from splitting across a page.

## 11. Restraint, and who it is for

Everything above is about what a thing looks like. This section is about how much of it there is,
which turned out to be the harder half.

The feedback was that the app overwhelms somebody just getting started, and it was fair on every
screen a stranger meets first. Today rendered eleven panels to everybody. The landing page ran to
ten sections before the sign-up button at the bottom. First run asked ten questions across eight
screens. The practice hub laid out thirteen modes in one flat grid, each with a two-sentence
paragraph. The desktop rail listed fifteen destinations with no grouping. None of that was wrong,
and all of it was true and useful to somebody. There was simply too much of it before the decision.

Three moves, and they are the ones to reach for again.

**Stage it.** `lib/ux/disclosure.ts` is the one table of what a screen leads with, keyed on how far
the learner has actually got. A figure computed from an empty log is not information, it is
furniture: a streak of nought, a ring at nought percent, a word of the day drawn at random from a
dictionary nobody has opened. Hold those back until they say something, and never hold back the way
in. Each stage is a superset of the one before, because a panel that appears and then disappears
reads as a fault.

**Group it.** Thirteen practice modes in one grid make the reader do the sorting. The daily loop,
the quick rounds, the five that work a named weakness and the mock paper are four groups that answer
"what should I do with the next five minutes" by their headings alone, which is what the page
claimed to do and was not doing. Same on the rail: four destinations that are the app, and the other
eleven behind one disclosure that opens itself whenever the current page is inside it.

**Fold it, do not cut it.** The comparison table on the landing page is eight checkable claims
against three real products, three of them ticks for somebody else, and deleting it to save scroll
would have been the cheapest kind of tidying: it is the block that makes the rest checkable. It is
behind its own summary now. The same applies to the plan's working, which is on `/assess`. Nothing that was true stopped being said; it stopped
being said in the way of somebody who has not decided yet.

What none of this licenses is hiding a thing because a screen looks busy. The test is whether the
panel can say anything yet to the person in front of it. Where the answer is yes, it stays.

## 12. Voice

Everything above is what the app looks like. This is what it sounds like, and it is part of the
design system for the same reason type and colour are: it is a property of every screen, decided
once, and a screen that gets it wrong is off-system even when every token in it is right.

The standard is **warm, kind, concise, and unmistakably a person**. `docs/18-voice.md` is the full
version with worked before-and-after examples, and it is the one to read before writing a sentence
anybody will see. The short version:

**Warmth is attention, not enthusiasm.** `Six days in a row` is warmer than `Amazing work!`
because
it is about the learner and required us to have been looking. Praise adjectives and exclamation
marks are the cheap substitute and read as such.

**Kindness is where the news is bad**, which is most of the copy on any screen worth designing: the
wrong answer, the empty deck, the search that found nothing, the paper that did not pass. Say the
true thing plainly, then say what to do next. Never soften a correction into vagueness, because a
learner left unsure whether they were wrong will rehearse the error.

**Concise has no word count.** Cut anything that restates the heading, anything explaining why we
are telling them, and any sentence that exists to round the paragraph off.

**Never sound generated.** `lib/copy/voice.ts` is the one table: no em dash or en dash, no stock
openers (`It's important to note that`, `Moreover`, `In conclusion`), no inflated shapes
(`not just a rule, but a pattern`), no brochure vocabulary (`delve`, `leverage`, `seamless`, `empower`,
`embark on`, `your journey`, `a plethora of`, `whether you're a beginner or`), and no emoji. It is swept over every
reader-facing line of `app/`, `lib/`, `components/` and the README, and Anu is given the same rules
from the same table.

Two of these bind the visual system directly. **Emoji are banned because there is already an icon
system**: data that drives UI carries a lucide icon name and `components/icons.tsx` is the only
place one becomes a component, so an emoji in a heading is a second icon set with no tokens behind
it. The check is narrow on purpose, since the arrow in "Estonian to English", the return key in a
keyboard hint and the tick on the week strip are typographic glyphs in one colour doing a job no
word does as well. And **an empty cell is `NO_VALUE`**, which is "n/a" from `lib/copy/values.ts`,
never a typed dash: in a table of forms a bare hyphen reads as a one-character form, and beside a
percentage as a minus sign whose digits failed to load.
