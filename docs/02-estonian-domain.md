# The Estonian Domain Model

This is the most important document in the repository. Every other feature is a view onto the model
described here. If the domain model is right, the app teaches Estonian; if it is wrong, the app is a
tab bar with a chat window in it.

**Design principle.** No model ever supplies an Estonian form. The app *retrieves* the forms that
cannot be predicted from Ekilex, stores them as principal parts, and builds only what is genuinely a
fixed ending on one of them: the ten regular cases on the genitive stem, the plural obliques on the
genitive plural, and the present, negative, conditional and imperative on the stored first person.
A derivation is wrong the same way for every word that takes the ending, so it is one bug found once,
and every derived form says on screen that it was worked out (ADR-005 amendment 1). Estonian
morphophonology is too irregular for anything beyond that, and a confidently wrong form is worse
than no form, so where no rule reaches, the form is stored or it is not shown.

**Naming principle.** Every table in this document names a form in Estonian first, because that is
how the language is taught: *ainsuse omastav*, not "genitive singular". The app follows the same
rule on every screen (ADR-023). A case is identified by its Estonian name and by the question it
answers, which is the pair a class hears together. The Latin name appears on no screen at all; the English
beside a case is what its question asks, and this document keeps the Latin names in its tables
only as a cross-reference for anyone reading an English grammar. The verb is named
by *aeg*, *kõneviis*, *tegumood* and *pööre* rather than by a row of English-shaped tenses, of which
Estonian inflects for two. `lib/estonian/terms.ts` holds the terms, and holds none for a point where
a class has no settled one.

## 1. Nouns: principal parts, not "3 of 14 cases"

Estonian has 14 cases. Only a handful of forms are unpredictable; the rest are regular suffixes on a
known stem. The unpredictable ones are the **principal parts** (*põhivormid*), and they are the only
thing worth memorizing.

### 1.1 The seven noun principal parts

| # | Form | Estonian name | `raamat` (book) | `tuba` (room) | Why it must be stored |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Nominative sg | *ainsuse nimetav* | raamat | tuba | The citation form |
| 2 | **Genitive sg** | *ainsuse omastav* | raamatu | toa | **Stem for 10 other cases** |
| 3 | Partitive sg | *ainsuse osastav* | raamatut | tuba | Irregular; required for objects, numbers, quantities |
| 4 | Short illative sg | *lühike sisseütlev* | n/a | tuppa | Exists for some words only; unpredictable |
| 5 | Nominative pl | *mitmuse nimetav* | raamatud | toad | Suppletive for pronouns; absent for mass nouns |
| 6 | Partitive pl | *mitmuse osastav* | raamatuid | tube | Highly irregular |
| 7 | Genitive pl | *mitmuse omastav* | raamatute | tubade | Stem for the plural oblique cases |

v4.0 stored only #1-3. #4 and #6 cannot be derived, so a three-form model silently teaches an
incomplete set of forms. #4 is nullable, and so are #5 and #7.

#5 was the last one to arrive and it arrived by measurement. It was written as a rule, genitive
plus `-d`, and `npm run audit:cases` put that to the Institute of the Estonian Language for every
nominal in the dictionary: right for 5,098 of 5,143 words and wrong for a whole category. A pronoun
is suppletive there and no ending reaches it, so `see` goes to **need** and the rule gave `selled`,
`too` to **nood** and it gave `tolled`, while `kes` and `mis` do not change at all and were given
`kelled` and `milled`. Thirty-three mass nouns (`sealiha`, `sularaha`) have no plural for a
lexicographer to record and were being handed one.

### 1.2 What the genitive buys you

This is the single most motivating fact for a beginner and the UI should say it out loud: learn the
genitive and ten cases fall out as regular suffixes.

| Case | Estonian | Suffix on genitive stem | `raamatu-` | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Inessive | *seesütlev* | `-s` | raamatus | in the book |
| Elative | *seestütlev* | `-st` | raamatust | out of the book |
| Allative | *alaleütlev* | `-le` | raamatule | onto the book |
| Adessive | *alalütlev* | `-l` | raamatul | on the book |
| Ablative | *alaltütlev* | `-lt` | raamatult | off the book |
| Translative | *saav* | `-ks` | raamatuks | becoming a book |
| Terminative | *rajav* | `-ni` | raamatuni | up to the book |
| Essive | *olev* | `-na` | raamatuna | as a book |
| Abessive | *ilmaütlev* | `-ta` | raamatuta | without the book |
| Comitative | *kaasaütlev* | `-ga` | raamatuga | with the book |

The oblique plural is built on the genitive plural, which no rule reaches either, which is why #7
is stored; where the dictionary holds none, the plural obliques show a gap rather than a guess. The nominative plural looks like a rule and is not one, which is
why it is #5 and stored rather than derived: see §1.1.

The dictionary UI renders this as a **generated table clearly marked as derived**, alongside the
stored forms marked as authoritative. The learner sees which forms they must memorize and which
they get for free. That framing *is* the pedagogy.

### 1.2a Two sets of local cases, and which one a word takes

Six of the ten above are *local* cases and they come in two sets. The inside three (*seesütlev*,
*seestütlev*, *sisseütlev*) are about being in something; the outside three (*alalütlev*,
*alaltütlev*, *alaleütlev*) are about being on it, and are also the ones Estonian uses for the
person or animal a thing is given to, taken from, or belongs to.

| | Inside | Outside |
|---|---|---|
| A room | toas, toast, tuppa | |
| A country in *-maa* | | Saksamaal, Saksamaalt, Saksamaale |
| A horse | | hobusel, hobuselt, hobusele |
| A teacher | | õpetajal, õpetajalt, õpetajale |

Which set a word takes is a fact about its **meaning**, so no rule over its spelling reaches it:
`hobusesse` is a perfectly derivable word and is not how anybody talks about a horse. The app reads
the Institute's own semantic type for the word's primary sense (`loom`, `in_elukutse`,
`koht_hoone`), which arrives in the same Ekilex response as the forms, and
`lib/estonian/caseQuestion.ts` is the one module every generator asks. A word the Institute
classifies as both a being and a place (`politsei`, `grupp`) takes both sets in ordinary Estonian
and is drilled on neither, the same answer `maa` gets.

The two interrogative pronouns follow the same fact and decline alike through all fourteen cases:
`kes` for a person or an animal, `mis` for a thing. So a card asks `hobune → kellega?` and `raamat →
millega?`. The adverbial questions `kus?`, `kuhu?` and `kust?` each name one case from **each** set,
so they are part of a case's name and never the question on a card about one word.

### 1.3 Consonant gradation (*astmevaheldus*)

The reason principal parts are unpredictable. A stem alternates between a **strong grade** and a
**weak grade** as the word inflects.

**Vältevaheldus: quantitative gradation.** The *quantity* (Q3 ↔ Q2) changes; the spelling usually
does not. `kooli` (Q3, "into the school") and `kooli` (Q2, "of the school") are written identically
and differ only in duration. This is invisible on the page, which is why audio is required data and
not decoration. See §1.4.

**Laadivaheldus: qualitative gradation.** The consonant itself weakens, changes or disappears.

| Pattern | Strong : weak | Gloss |
|---|---|---|
| kk : k | `lukk : luku` | lock |
| pp : p | `sepp : sepa` | smith |
| tt : t | `pott : poti` | pot |
| k : g | `märk : märgi` | sign |
| p : b | `kaup : kauba` | goods |
| t : d | `kartma : kardan` | to fear : I fear |
| b : ∅ | `tuba : toa` | room |
| g : ∅ | `lugema : loen` | to read : I read |
| d : j | `sada : saja` | hundred |
| s : ∅ | `uus : uue` | new |

Note `tuba : toa`: the `b` disappears *and* the stem vowel changes. Nothing in the nominative
predicts this, which is precisely why the genitive is a stored principal part rather than a computed
one.

Each lexeme is tagged with its **gradation type** (`none` / `quantitative` / `qualitative`) and,
where derivable, the specific alternation. This tag drives:
- a badge in the dictionary entry,
- a dedicated **gradation drill** card type (`07-srs.md`),
- filtering ("show me every qualitative-gradation noun I know"),
- Anu's explanations, which cite the pattern by name rather than hand-waving.

### 1.4 A note on quantity

Estonian has three phonological quantities (Q1/Q2/Q3). Q2 and Q3 are frequently **not distinguished
in orthography**: `linna` (genitive, Q2) and `linna` (short illative, Q3) are spelled identically
and differ only in duration. Two consequences:
- A text-only flashcard cannot always disambiguate; audio is not decoration, it is required data.
- The TTS clip for a form is part of the card, not an add-on. This is a direct argument for A4's
  TartuNLP integration over an absent browser voice.

## 2. Verbs: five principal parts

v4.0 stored `lugema` / `lugeda`. Those two cannot generate a conjugation, because the present stem
is in the weak grade and unguessable from the infinitive.

| # | Form | Estonian name | `lugema` | `tulema` | Generates |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ma-infinitive | *ma-tegevusnimi* | lugema | tulema | Citation form; `-mas/-mast/-maks/-mata` |
| 2 | da-infinitive | *da-tegevusnimi* | lugeda | tulla | Complement of many verbs; imperative base |
| 3 | **Present 1sg** | *oleviku ainsuse 1. pööre* | **loen** | **tulen** | The whole present tense |
| 4 | Past 1sg | *lihtmineviku ainsuse 1. pööre* | lugesin | tulin | The simple past, except its third person |
| 5 | tud-participle | *umbisikuline mineviku kesksõna* | loetud | tuldud | Passive, perfect, `saama`-passive |

Note `lugema → loen`: `g` disappears and the vowel changes. No rule recovers this. It is stored.

The past third person is not derivable for any verb (`lugesin` goes to `luges` but `tahtsin` to
`tahtis`), and neither are the polite imperative or the two participles, so the harvest stores those
per verb as well. `unreachableSlots` in `lib/estonian/conjugate.ts` is the list of what the rule
cannot reach, and `npm run audit:verbs` checks every derived slot against Ekilex.

---

## 3. Object case: the highest-value grammar concept

The single most persistent error for an English speaker, and completely absent from v4.0.

Estonian encodes **aspect and completeness in the case of the object**:

| Sentence | Object case | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Lugesin **raamatut**. | partitive | I was reading the book / read at it (ongoing, partial) |
| Lugesin **raamatu** läbi. | genitive (total) | I read the book (completed, whole) |
| Ostsin **leiba**. | partitive | I bought some bread |
| Ostsin **leiva**. | genitive (total) | I bought the (whole) loaf |

The rule of thumb: **partitive** for ongoing, negated, partial or unbounded events; **total object**
(genitive sg / nominative pl) for completed, bounded, whole ones. Negation always takes partitive.

Modeled as:
- a `GrammarConcept` record with worked examples and a canonical explanation,
- a dedicated **minimal-pair card type**: the learner picks the case and gets told which reading
  their choice produced,
- a preset chip in Anu: *"Which object case does this sentence need, and why?"*

---

## 4. Verb government (*rektsioon*)

Which case a verb demands of its complement. Unlearnable by analogy from English; must be stored per
verb and drilled.

| Verb | Governs | Example | English trap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aitama` | partitive | aitan **sind** | "help *to* you" |
| `helistama` | allative | helistan **sulle** | "call *to* you" |
| `meeldima` | allative experiencer | **mulle** meeldib see | inverted: "to-me pleases this" |
| `mõtlema` | `-le` / `peale` | mõtlen **sinule** | n/a |
| `uskuma` | partitive / `-sse` | usun **sind** | n/a |
| `vastama` | allative | vastan **küsimusele** | "answer *to* the question" |

Stored as a `government` relation on the lexeme: `{ case, preposition?, example, gloss }`. Surfaced
as a badge in the dictionary entry and as its own card type. For a class-based learner this is
exactly the material that class notes cover and no dictionary displays well.

## 5. Data sourcing and trust levels

Every morphological fact carries a provenance tag, and the UI shows it. This is a correctness
feature: the learner must know which forms are authoritative.

| Level | Source | Trust | UI treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EKILEX` | Ekilex API form data | Authoritative | Shown plainly |
| `DERIVED` | Suffix applied to a stored genitive stem | High, mechanical | Shown, labelled "derived" |
| `AI` | Suggested by Anu | **Unverified** | Never vouched for: `vouchable` refuses it for a scan, a headline, the word of the day and the chat check, until Ekilex answers for it |
| `USER` | Typed in by the learner | As reliable as the learner | Editable, marked |

**Hard rule:** an `AI`-provenance form is never written into a flashcard's answer field without an
explicit user confirmation step. LLMs are strong at *explaining* Estonian morphology and unreliable
at *producing* rare inflected forms. The architecture reflects that asymmetry: Anu explains, Ekilex
supplies. See `06-anu-tutor.md` §5.

---

## 6. Level model

The learner is in a structured class, so the app tracks where they are.

- **CEFR levels** A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 on the profile and, where Ekilex supplies it, per lexeme.
- Estonian state language exams (*eesti keele tasemeeksam*) are offered at A2, B1, B2 and C1. The
  target a learner picks in first run is what the plan, the readiness rungs and the mock exam are
  read against, which gives the app a goal to organize around rather than an open-ended word list.
- Vocabulary is tied to the syllabus by unit (`lib/collections/syllabus/`) rather than by class
  week; the class-week tagging this section first proposed went with the task list.
