/*
 * Kodukeel's service worker.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately narrow: keep the app *openable* without a connection, so
 * a review session can start on a bus. It does not try to make the whole app
 * work offline — the dictionary needs Ekilex and the tutor needs a provider, and
 * pretending otherwise would serve convincing stale pages.
 *
 * It is not a sync engine either. Grades made offline are held in IndexedDB by
 * lib/offline/db.ts and replayed by the page through a Server Action, because
 * replaying one from a worker would mean duplicating auth, ordering and
 * idempotency out here where none of it can be tested.
 *
 * Three rules keep this from ever serving something wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Only GETs are cached.** Every mutation in this app is a POST (Server
 *    Actions and Route Handlers), and a cached mutation is a corrupted deck.
 *    The one exception is /api/tts, handled explicitly below.
 * 2. **Navigations are network-first.** The cache is a fallback for when the
 *    network fails, never a faster stale answer — a flashcard app that shows
 *    yesterday's due count because it felt quicker is worse than a slow one.
 * 3. **Nothing under /api/ is cached** except that speech, which is immutable.
 *
 * And a fourth, learned one layer up and not applied here until now:
 *
 * 4. **Every cache is bounded.** `lib/audio/clipCache.ts` exists because a
 *    cache that never evicts is a leak with a hit rate, and both caches down
 *    here had exactly that shape. Speech is a WAV per phrase and review plays
 *    audio on nearly every card, so a phone kept every clip it had ever heard;
 *    the shell cache is worse, because `_next/static` filenames are hashed per
 *    build and `VERSION` is typed by hand, so every deploy added a fresh set of
 *    chunks under the same cache name and nothing ever removed the old ones.
 *    Neither had a ceiling, and when storage for the origin is finally
 *    evicted the browser takes the whole thing, including /offline, which is
 *    the one entry with no fallback of its own.
 */

/*
  Bumped to v3 so `activate` clears what v2 accumulated.

  `activate` deletes every `kodukeel-` cache that is not this version's, which
  is the only thing that has ever removed a stale entry here — and since the
  version is typed by hand and had not changed across many deploys, an install
  that had been running for months was carrying every hashed chunk of every
  build it had ever seen and every clip it had ever played. The ceilings below
  stop that happening again; this bump is what clears the arrears.

  connection failure into a browser error page. STATIC is hashed build output,
  which is exactly what grows without limit, so that is where the ceiling
  goes. Putting both in one cache and trimming it would eventually evict the
  offline page to make room for a chunk.

  Ceilings, in entries.

  Counted rather than measured in bytes, for the reason `clipCache.ts` gives:
  a count is a bound a person can check, and the Cache API will not tell you
  what an entry costs without reading it back.

  Audio: a long review session meets a few hundred distinct phrases, and a
  clip heard once a month ago is not one anybody is about to ask for again.
  Static: one build of this app is well under a hundred chunks, so this is
  roughly the current build plus the one before it, which is what makes a
  deploy landing mid-session survivable.

  the app. FIFO over a ceiling this size costs an occasional re-fetch of
